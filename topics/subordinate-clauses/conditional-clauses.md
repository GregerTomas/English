# Conditional clauses

## Commas

The usage of commas depends on the order of the clauses. If the sentence starts with the conditional clause, we use the
comma, otherwise we do not.

> We'll be late if you don't hurry up. 🆚 If you don't hurry up, we'll be late. <br/>
> He would ask her out, if she were single. 🆚 If she were single, he would ask her out. <br/>

## Conditionals

### Zero conditional

💡 co dělám, když

It is used for the permanent truths. Both clauses are typically in the present tense. We can use either the
conjunction **when** or **if**.

> If / when I'm hungry, I have something to eat. <br/>
> If / when I'm not hungry, I don't eat. <br/>
> We don't play outside if / when it's raining. <br/>
> If / when I need help, I ask for it. <br/>
> Water boils if / when you heat it to 100 degrees. <br/>

### 1st conditional

💡 jestli ... tak ..., když ... tak ..., -li ... tak ...

They are **real and possible** conditions for the present. Something will happen in the future, if the condition is met.

#### Grammar

We use a verb in the present tense in the conditional clause, and the future tense in the main clause (typically **
will**, but even **may** can be used).

We do not use the future tense in the 1st conditional clauses.

> 🔴 If I will have time, I will go there. ➡ 🟢 If I have time, I will go there. 💡*Pokud budu mít čas, půjdu tam.* <br/>
> If the weather is good, I will go out. 💡*Pokud bude dobré počasí, půjdu ven.* <br/>
> If you don't tell me the truth, I will kick you. <br/>
> If I win, I will move abroad. <br/>
> If I see him, I will give him your message. <br/>
> We'll be late if you don't hurry up. <br/>
> If it rains tomorrow, I may stay home. <br/>
> If I stay home, I may lose my job. <br/>

#### Imperative

The future tense is in neither of the clauses.

> Shout if you need anything. <br/>
> If you get lost, call me. <br/>
> If they ask for help, help them. <br/>
> Wear a hat if it snows. <br/>

### 2nd conditional

💡 kdyby ... tak by ... (co by bylo, kdyby)

They are **unreal, theoretical** conditions for the present. The conditions are not met, or are unlikely to be met.

#### Grammar

We use a verb in the past tense in the conditional clause (
or [conjunctive](/topics/parts-of-speech/verbs/conjunctive.md)), and **would** in the main clause.

> If I had the money, I'd buy a car. 💡*Kdybych měl peníze (ale nemám), koupil bych si auto (neočekávám to).<br/>
> If the weather was nice, we'd go on a trip. 💡*Kdyby bylo hezké počasí (ale není / asi nebude), vyrazili bychom na
> výlet (ale asi nevyrazíme).* <br/>
> If we won, we would celebrate. <br/>
> If I needed anything, I would call you. <br/>
> If I were you, I wouldn't trust him. <br/>

Because we can use **conjunctive** in the conditional clause, we can use the verb **were** for all persons.

> If the weather were nice ... 💡*Kdyby bylo hezky* <br/>
> If I were you ... 💡*Kdybych byl tebou* <br/>
> If she were single ... 💡*Kdyby byla svobodná* <br/>

The verb **could** is often used in these clauses, either in the main clause or in the conditional clause.

> If cats **could** talk, they would tell our secrets. <br/>
> If he **could** go anywhere, he would go to Thailand. <br/>
> If it stopped raining, we **could** have a picnic. <br/>
> I **could** buy it for you if it was a little cheaper. <br/>

### 3rd conditional

💡 co by se bývalo stalo (v minulosti), kdyby (v minulosti), hypotetické, teoretické situace v minulosti

💡 v češtině už pro druhý a třetí kondicionál používáme výhradně přítomný podmiňovací způsob (lze použít samozřejmě i
minulý)

They are **unreal,** conditions for the past.

> Kdyby (teď) bylo hezky, šli bychom ven. 💡*přítomná nereálná podmínka, druhý kondicionál* <br/>
> Kdyby (tehdy) bylo hezky, šli bychom ven. 🔃 Kdyby bývalo hezky, byli bychom šli ven. 💡*minulá nereálná podmínka, třetí
> kondicionál* <br/>

#### Grammar

We use **had + past participle** in the conditional clause, and **would + perfect infitnitive** in the main clause.

> If you had listened to me, you wouldn't have had to pay the fine. 💡*Kdybys mě (býval) poslechl, nemusel jsi (býval)
platit.* <br/>
> If I had bought a better phone, it wouldn't have broken. 💡*Kdybych si (býval) koupil lepší telefon, (býval) by se
nerozbil.* <br/>
> If I had asked for directions, I would have arrived sooner. 💡*Kdybych se (býval) zeptal, dorazil bych (býval)
dříve.* <br/>
> If she hadn't cheated, it wouldn't have happened to her. 💡*Kdyby (bývala) nepodváděla, (bývalo) by se jí to
nestalo.* <br/>
> If I hadn't been unlucky, I would have passed the exam. <br/>
> If he had finished his studies, he would have become a teacher. <br/>
> You would have caught the bus if you had left the house earlier. <br/>
> They wouldn't have gotten wet in the rain if they had taken a taxi. <br/>
> The dog wouldn't have bitten him if he hadn't broken into our garden. <br/>
> She wouldn't have entered the beauty contest if her friends hadn't talked her into it. <br/>
> They would have won if the opponent hadn't cheated. <br/>
> She would have died if they hadn't taken her to the hospital. <br/>
> I would have worn a suit and tie if they had told me it was a formal party. <br/>
> If you had told me about the problem sooner, I would have been able to help you. <br/>

#### Pronunciation

In the 🗣 spoken English, following words are pronounced shortly.

| word  | full pronunciation | reduced pronunciation |
|-------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| had	  | /hæd/	             | /əd/                  |
| would | 	/wʊd/	            | /wəd/                 |
| have  | 	/hæv/	            | /əv/                  |

### Mixed conditionals

We can mix 2nd a 3rd conditional together in two ways.

#### Condition in the past, result in the present

We take the conditional clause from the 3rd conditional, and the main clause from the 2nd conditional.

> If I hadn't met my wife, I wouldn't have such a beautiful family. 💡*Kdybych býval nepotkal svoji ženu (v minulosti),
neměl bych tak krásnou rodinu (nyní).* <br/>
> If I had studied more when I was young, I would certainly have a better job now. 💡*Kdybych se býval v mládí lépe
učil (tehdy), měl bych nyní lepší práci (nyní).* <br/>
> If I had had breakfast, I wouldn't be hungry now. <br/>

#### Condition in the present, result in the past

The condition is related to a permanent truth (i.e., the present). We take the conditional clause from the 2nd
conditional, and the main clause from the 3rd conditional.

> If I wasn't lazy, I would have helped them. 💡*Kdybych nebyl tak líný (pro přítomnost používáme minulý čas), býval bych
jim pomohl (tehdy).* <br/>
> If she wasn't so pretty, I would have never fallen in love with her. 💡*Kdyby nebyla tak pěkná (stále – i nyní – proto
minulý čas), nikdy bych se do ní nebyl zamiloval (týká se to minulosti – já se do ní zamiloval).* <br/>
> If I liked pizza, I would have gone to the pizzeria with you. <br/>

### Real (open) conditionals

💡 jestli ... tak ..., když ... tak ..., -li ... tak ...

They express real / possible conditions and can be used in different tenses.

#### Different tenses

**future tense** (see [1st conditional](#1st-conditional))

> We'll stay in if it rains tomorrow. <br/>
> What will you do if the job interview doesn't work out? <br/>

**present tense**

We use the present tense in both clauses.

> If he's at home, I'm sure he's watching television. 💡*Dotyčný je možná doma, a pokud ano, potom se určitě dívá na
televizi.* <br/>
> You're crazy if you like that girl. 💡*Jestli se mu ta dívka líbí (a možná se mu líbí), potom je blázen.* <br/>

**past tense**

We use the past tense in both clauses.

> If it rained, they probably stayed at home. 💡*Mluvčí připouští možnost, neví, jestli pršelo, ale říká, že jestli
pršelo, potom pravděpodobně zůstali doma. Je zde tedy možnost, že nikam nešli, ale zůstali doma.* <br/>

#### Mixed conditionals

We can combine different tenses in the sentence. Only one rule applies, the future tense cannot be used in the
conditional clause. See some examples bellow, other tenses are also possible.

**conditional in past + result in future**

> If she missed her bus this morning, she will be late. 💡*Je možné, že jí ujel autobus, v tom případě přijde pozdě. A
jestli jí neujel, potom asi přijde včas.* <br/>

**conditional in present + result in future**

> If she's lying, I won't talk to her again. 💡*Možná lže, možná nelže, ale jestli ano (ta možnost tu je), už s ní
nepromluvím.* <br/>

**conditional in present + result in past**

> If he's not on holiday, he lied to us! 💡*Je možné že není na dovolené, a jestli ne, potom nám lhal. Je tedy možné, že
nám lhal.* <br/>

## Binding be + infinitive

We can express the future tense even with the binding **be + infinitive**. ⏳[TODO see article].

In an ordinary condition clause, the condition must be met before the action in the main clause take place.

> If I pass the exam, I will celebrate. <br/>

In opposite, in the clauses with **be + infinitive**, the action in the main clause must happen first. The same meaning
we can achieve by using **want**

> If I'm to pass the exam, I'll have to study a lot. 🔃 If I want to pass the exam, I will need to study a lot. 💡*Jestli
mám složit tu zkoušku, budu se muset hodně učit* <br/>
> If I'm to help you, you'll have to do something for me too. 🔃 If you want me to help you, you will have to do
> something for me too. 💡*Jestli ti mám pomoct, budeš pro mě muset taky něco udělat.* <br/>
> If she's to study abroad, she'll need to get a job first. 🔃 If she wants to study abroad, she'll need to get a job
> first. <br/>

## Conjunctions

### Unless

💡 jestli ne, pokud ne

It is equal to **if not**.

> I won't help you unless you help me. 🔃 if you don't help me. <br/>
> We'll go out unless she's too busy. 🔃 if she isn't too busy. <br/>

### Provided, providing (that)

💡 za předpokladu, že

> I'll take the job **provided they offer me a good salary. <br/>
> I'll take the job **providing (that)** they offer me a good salary. <br/>

### On condition (that)

💡 pod podmínkou, že

> I'll tell you a secret **on condition (that)** you don't tell anyone. <br/>

### As long as

💡 pokud

It can also be used in the time clauses (💡*dokud*).

> I like spending weekends with my parents **as long as** they don't start trying to talk me into getting married and
> settling down.

### If 🆚 when 🆚 in case (of)

#### In case of something

💡 v případě, pokud, jestli

This prepositional phrase is quite familiar and is used when you want to point out what to do when, for example, a
threat happens.

> In case of fire, break the glass. <br/>
> In case of emergency, press this button. <br/>
> She knows how to get out in case of emergency. <br/>

It has almost similar meaning as a condition clause.

> In case of fire, break the glass. 🔃 If there is a fire, break the glass. <br/>

#### In case

💡 pro případ, že (by) / kdyby náhodou, že (by)

We want to do something preventive. We are preparing for a situation which could happen. It is not a conditional clause.

> I'll give you his number **in case** you need it. 💡*Dám ti to číslo **kdybys** ho potřeboval.* <br/>
> I'll give you his number **if** you need it. 💡*Dám ti to číslo, **pokud / jestli** ho potřebuješ / budeš
potřebovat.* <br/>
> I'll give you his number **when** you need it. 💡*Dám ti to číslo, **až** ho budeš potřebovat.* <br/>

> You should pack your swimsuit in case there's a pool. 💡*Měla by sis zabalit plavky pro případ, že tam bude bazén (

pokud, jestli), že tam je bazén. Běž se podívat na jejich web.* <br/>

> I'll take an umbrella in case it rains. 💡*Vezmu si (raději) deštník pro případ (kdyby náhodou), že bude pršet.* <br/>

> We'll buy more wine in case more people come. 💡*Koupíme více vína pro případ (kdyby), že přijde více lidí.* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>

> You should insure the parcel in case it gets damaged. 🆚 You will lose a lot of money if it gets damaged and it isn't
> insured. <br/>
> Take out insurance in case the shipment gets damaged. 🆚 Use the insurance if the shipment gets damaged. <br/>
> I'll give you my phone number in case you have any questions. 🆚 Call me if you have any questions. <br/>
> I don't want to leave my office in case Mr Jones phones. 🆚 If Mr Jones phones and I'm not in the office, he's going to
> use a different provider. <br/>
> I'll make more salad in case you're hungry when you get back. 🆚 You can have the salad if you're hungry when you get
> back. <br/>
> I'll take some cash in case they don't accept credit cards. 🆚 I can withdraw some cash from an ATM later if they don't
> accept credit cards. <br/>
> I've bought a chicken in case your mother wants to stay for dinner. 🆚 I will make the chicken if your mother wants to
> stay for dinner. <br/>
> Take a map in case we get lost. 🆚 We will use the map if we get lost. <br/>
> You should keep some candles in case there's a power cut again. 🆚 You can light the candles if there's a power
> cut. <br/>
> Let's take some sandwiches in case we get hungry. 🆚 We can eat the sandwiches if we get hungry. <br/>

It can be also used in the past tense.

> I took some cash in case they didn't accept credit cards, but they did. <br/>
> I took an umbrella in case it rained, but the sky was clear the whole time. <br/>
> We took a map in case we got lost, but we found their house easily. <br/>
> I gave him your phone number in case he needed to call you. <br/>
> I knocked very loudly in case they didn't hear me. <br/>

We can use **should** with it.

> I'll give you my number in case you should need it. 💡*Dám vám své číslo, kdybyste ho měl potřebovat.* <br/>
> I'll give you my number in case there should be some changes in the plan. 💡*Dám vám své číslo pro případ, že by mělo
dojít k nějakým změnám v plánu.* <br/>
> I bought more meat yesterday in case we should need it. <br/>
> She wrote down the name of the oil in case she should forget it. <br/>

We can use the present or past tense after it, not the future tense.

> 🔴 I'll give you my number in case you will need it. ➡ 🟢 I'll give you my number in case you need it. <br/>
> I gave him my number in case he needed it. <br/>
