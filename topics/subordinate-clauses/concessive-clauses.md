# Concessive clause

💡 přípustkové věty (přestože, i když, ačkoliv), něco tvrdíme, ale připouštíme něco jiného

## Grammar

### Future tense

We do not use the future tense, but only the present tense. The same way as with time and conditional clauses.

> 🔴 No matter what you **will do**, I will love you. ➡ 🟢 No matter what you **do**, I will love you. <br/>
> 🔴 Wherever you **will go**, I will follow you. ➡ 🟢 Wherever you **go**, I will follow you. <br/>

### Shortened clauses

If the subject of both clauses is the same and the verb **be** is used in the concessive clause, we omit the subject and
the verb **be**.

> **Although the game was difficult**, it turned out to be enjoyable. ➡ **Although difficult**, the game turned out to
> be enjoyable. <br/>
> **Whether you're rich or poor**, you can join our club. ➡ **Whether rich or poor**, you can join our club. <br/>
> Peter, **though he isn't very tall**, plays basketball. ➡ Peter, **though not very tall**, plays basketball. <br/>

## Although, though, even though

💡 ačkoliv, ač, i když

These words are conjunctions and stands before the concessive clause. **Though** means the same as **although** and is
more common in 🗣 informal English. **Even though** emphasize the
contradiction of both information.

> **Although** I hadn't eaten anything all day, I wasn't hungry. <br/>
> I didn't pass the test **even though** I had studied all night. <br/>
> She bought the coat **though** it was quite expensive. <br/>
> He helped me although he was very busy. 🆚 He helped me even though he was very busy. <br/>

### Even though 🆚 even if

See also [emphasize a conjunctions](/topics/parts-of-speech/conjunctions/conjunctions.md#emphasize-a-conjunction).

> **even if** - conditional clause (very close to concessive clause) <br/>
> **even though** - concessive clause <br/>

We use **even though** when we know that it is, was, or will be. On the other hand, we use **even if** when we don't
know if it will be, was or is, we just say what would be.

> Even if I wanted ... 💡*i kdybych chtěl (ale nechci)*
> 🆚 <br/>
> Even though I wanted ... 💡*i když jsem chtěl (opravdu jsem chtěl)* <br/>

> Even if you help me ... 💡*i když mi pomůžeš (nevím, jestli mi pomůžeš)* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> Even though you help me ... 💡*i když mi pomáháš (pomáháš mi)* <br/>

## Despite, in spite of

💡 navzdory, i přes

**Despite** is rather ✏ formal and is used in written English, and **in spite of** is informal and is used in 🗣 spoken
English.

These words are prepositions and stand before a noun, pronoun or gerund.

> 🔴 Despite it was raining, we went to the zoo. ➡ 🟢 Despite the rain, we went to the zoo. <br/>
> 🔴 In spite of he was tired, he decided to help me. ➡ 🟢 In spite of being tired, he decided to help me. <br/>

If we want to use gerund, subject in the main and subordinate clause must be the same. Otherwise, we can use phrase **
despite the fact that** or **in spite of the fact that**.
> Although it was really cold, Josh went snowboarding. <br/>
> ❌ Despite being cold, Josh went snowboarding. 💡*Zde bychom automaticky předpokládali, že podmět hlavní věty je zároveň
podmětem gerundia, tedy že JEMU (Joshovi) BYLA VELKÁ ZIMA. Tak to ale nebylo.* <br/>
> ➡ In spite of the fact that it was raining, we went to the zoo. 💡*too long for spoken English, used rather in written
English* <br/>

## However

💡 ale, však, avšak

It is not used for connecting two sentences (does not stand before the concessive clause), but it stands before a simple
sentence. In fact, it is not a conjunction but an adverb. It is separated with commas from the rest of the sentence.

> **Although** it was raining, we went to the zoo. 🆚 It was raining. **However**, we went to the zoo. <br/>
> I liked the film. My mother, **however**, didn't like it at all. <br/>

It has the same meaning as ordinary **but**, but punctuation is different. In 🗣 spoken English. we can also use **
though**, but it must be used at the end of the sentence.

> It was raining**, but** I went for a walk. 🆚 It was raining. **However,** I went for a walk. <br/>
> I love the film. My mother doesn't like it, though. <br/>

We have many ways to say the same thing.

> He isn't paid very well, but he doesn't want to leave his job. <br/>
> Although he isn't paid very well, he doesn't want to leave his job. <br/>
> Even though he isn't paid very well, he doesn't want to leave his job. <br/>
> Though he isn't paid very well, he doesn't want to leave his job. <br/>
> He doesn't want to leave his job although he isn't paid very well. <br/>
> He doesn't want to leave his job even though he isn't paid very well. <br/>
> He doesn't want to leave his job though he isn't paid very well. <br/>
> Despite not being paid very well, he doesn't want to leave his job. <br/>
> In spite of his poor salary, he doesn't want to leave his job. <br/>
> He isn't paid very well. However, he doesn't want to leave his job. <br/>
> He isn't paid very well. He doesn't want to leave his job though. <br/>

## While / whilst

💡 ačkoliv

**Whilst** is ✏ formal variant of **while**. **While** is also time conjunction,
see [time clauses](/topics/subordinate-clauses/time-clauses.md).

> While I share your opinion, I have certain doubts. 💡*Ačkoliv sdílím tvůj názor, mám jisté pochybnosti* <br/>
> While you may think it's great, not everyone shares your opinion. 💡*I když si možná myslíš, že je to dobré, ne všichni
sdílí tvůj názor.* <br/>
> Whilst they do need correct feeding, Huskies do not require as much food as other large breeds. <br/>

## Whether

We use **whether + or** in these clauses. **Wheter** can be also used in **object clauses**.

> **Whether** you're rich **or** poor, our club is for you! <br/>
> **Whether** you live here **or** not, you are a part of our family. <br/>

## No matter

💡 nehledě, bez ohledu

It is used with **wh- words** or with **whether / if**.

> **No matter if / whether** it is true or not, people will protest. <br/>

> **No matter what** you do, I will love you. <br/>
> **No matter where** you go, I will follow you. <br/>
> **No matter when** you come back, I will always welcome you with open arms. <br/>
> **No matter who** you marry, you must treat them with respect and love. <br/>
> **No matter whose** car you drive, you must be careful. <br/>
> **No matter why** you did it, you still have to be punished. <br/>
> **No matter how** you solve it, it counts. <br/>
> **No matter to whom** you pray, pray for me. <br/>
> **No matter which** you choose, it will be a good choice. <br/>

We can use words **wh- word + ever** instead of phrase **no matter + wh- word**.

> **No matter what** you do... 🔃 **Whatever** you do ... <br/>
> **No matter where** you go ... 🔃 Wherever you go ... <br/>
> **No matter when** you come back ... 🔃 Whenever you come back ... <br/>
> **No matter who** you marry ... 🔃 Whoever you marry ... <br/>
> **No matter which** you choose ... 🔃 Whichever you choose ... <br/>
> **No matter how** you solve it ... 🔃 However you solve it ... <br/>
> 🔴 whosever, whyever, whomever - are not generally used <br/>

This **wh- word + ever** - **no matter + wh- word** interchangeability is possible only for these clauses, not for
object or subject clauses.

> Whoever gets there first wins. 🔴 No matter who gets there first wins. 💡*subject clause* <br/>
> You can buy whatever you want. 🔴 You can buy no matter what you want. 💡*object clause* <br/>
