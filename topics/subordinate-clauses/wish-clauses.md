# With clauses

## Grammar

These clauses use the [unreal time](/topics/parts-of-speech/verbs/conjunctive.md).

## I wish, if only

💡 kéž by, kdyby tak

We can use the verb **wish** or a phrase **if only**. We can use the conjunction **that** after the verb **wish**.

> **I wish** I had more time for my friends. <br/>
> **If only** I could go back in time. <br/>
> **I wish that** I could fly. 🔃 **I wish** I could fly. <br/>
> He **wishes** he had more time for his kids. <br/>
> She **wished** she could disappear. <br/>

## Wishes for the present

### Regrets

💡 že je mi líto, že mě mrzí, že něco nějak je (či není)

We use a verb in the past tense. We do not use conditionals (**would**, **could**, etc.) in these clauses.

> I wish I had a girlfriend. <br/>
> I wish he understood me. <br/>
> I wish she didn't have a boyfriend. <br/>
> 🔴 I wish I would have more money. ➡ 🟢 I wish I had more money. <br/>

If the verb is **be**, we can use **were** for all persons.

> I wish you were here. <br/>
> I wish she was here with me. 🔃 I wish she were here with me. <br/>
> I wish I wasn't sick. 🔃 I wish I weren't sick. <br/>

### Wishes for something to happen

💡 přejeme, aby se něco stalo, aby někdo něco udělal (nyní nebo v budoucnu), vyčítání

We use the modal verb **would** in these clauses.

> I wish you would leave! 💡*Už odejdi, chci, abys už šel, tak už jdi!* <br/>
> I wish they would stop fighting! 💡*Ať už přestanou ...* <br/>
> I wish you wouldn't lie to me. 💡*Nelži ...* <br/>
> I wish he would stop calling me. <br/>
> She wishes he would quit smoking. <br/>

We cannot use these clauses for persons which has the particular wish, so for example I cannot wish that I could change
anything.

> 🔴 I wish **I would** stop smoking. ➡ 🟢 I wish **I could** stop smoking. <br/>

## Wishes for the past

### Regrets

💡 kéž by se to bývalo nestalo, či kéž by se bývalo stalo něco jinak (samozřejmě to ale už nyní nelze změnit)

We use a verb in the past perfect tense.

> I wish he had told me the truth. <br/>
> Now he wishes he had tried harder. <br/>
> Watching you play makes me wish I hadn't given up guitar when I was a kid. <br/>
> If only I had kept my mouth shut. Now everyone's mad at me. <br/>

## Wishes for the past

### Wishes for something to happen

We do not use a wish clause, but a sentence with the verb **hope**. We can use either present tense or future tense
after the verb **hope**, it depends on the meaning.

> 🔴 I wish it's sunny tomorrow. ➡ 🟢 I hope it's sunny tomorrow. <br/>
> I bought a lottery ticket. I hope I win. <br/>
> I hope everything is fine. 🆚 I hope everything will be fine. <br/>

## Wish outside wish clauses

Following clauses are not wish clauses.

**Wish** can be used as a ✏ formal variant of the verb **want**, or in the meaning 💡* popřát někomu*.

> If you wish to continue, press "ok". <br/>
> The course is good for people who wish to pursue a career in financial management. <br/>
> You can sit here, if you wish. <br/>

> They wished me luck. <br/>
> No one wished me happy birthday. <br/>
> I sent a card to wish him a speedy recovery. <br/>
