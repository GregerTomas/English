# Object clauses

## Grammar

These clauses replace the object of a sentence.

> I don't know his name. ➡ I don't know what his name is. <br/>
> He believes in God. ➡ He believes that there is a God. <br/>

### Comma

We do not use the comma in these clauses.

> 🔴 I don't know, his name. <br/>
> 🔴 I don't know, what his name is. <br/>

### Omitting that

> She said **that** she was hungry. ➡ She said she was hungry. <br/>
> I know **that** you like football. ➡ I know you like football. <br/>

### Will after if and when

In opposite to time and conditional clauses, we can use **will** after the conjunctions **if** and **when**.

> We will have dinner when you come. 💡*time clause* 🆚 I don't know when you will come. 💡*object clause* <br/>
> We will go out if we have the time. 💡*conditional clause* 🆚 I don't know if we will have the time. 💡*object
clause* <br/>

### Question word order

**not a question**
> Where are you? 🆚 🔴 I don't know where are you. ➡ 🟢 I don't know where you are. <br/>
> What's your name? 🆚 🔴 I don't know what's your name. ➡ 🟢 I don't know what your name is. <br/>
> What time did you get up? 🆚 🔴 I don't know what time did you get up. ➡ 🟢 I don't know what time you got up. <br/>

**the main clause behaves as a question, the subordinate clause doesn't**
> Where is the station? 🆚 🔴 Could you tell me where is the station? ➡ 🟢 Could you tell me where the station is? <br/>
> Where does he live? 🆚 🔴 Do you know where does he live? ➡ 🟢 Do you know where he lives? <br/>

### Prepositions

Prepositions are used at the end of a sentence. The same rule applies for [interrogative](⏳todo) and [relational](⏳todo)
clauses.

> I don't know **what** you are talking **about**. <br/>
> Tell me **what** you are looking **at**. <br/>

### Tense shift

The same rules which are used in the [indirect speech](⏳TODO) apply here.

> He didn't know what I was doing. 💡*Nevěděl, co dělám. (přítomný čas ➡ minulý čas)* <br/>

## Conjunctions and pronouns

**that** 💡že

> I think that it is an interesting job. <br/>

**what** 💡co

> I don't know what you want. <br/>

**who** 💡kdo

> I don't know who lives here. <br/>

**where** 💡kde

> I don't know where you live. <br/>

**when** 💡kdy

> Tell me when you will return. <br/>

**why** 💡proč

> I know why you are here. <br/>

**whose** 💡čí

> I don't know whose car this is. <br/>

**which** 💡který

> Tell me which of these books is better. <br/>

**how** 💡jak

> I don't know how I can get there. <br/>

**if** 💡jestli

> She didn't say if she was hungry. <br/>

**whether** 💡zda

See [this article](/topics/parts-of-speech/conjunctions/conjunctions.md#whether).

> I don't know whether I should go there. <br/>

## Object or time clause?

We can use an object clause after a verb which is followed by the object (the logical object of the verb).

> I don't know when he's coming back. <br/>
> She didn't say when she wanted to get married. <br/>

We use different grammar for verbs like **like**, **love**, **hate**, etc. The subordinate clause is not a grammatical
object of the verb. In this case, the clause is time or conditional clause. These verbs also belongs
between [transitive](⏳todo) verbs
so that they must have an object, we use **it** for this purpose.

Other verbs...
> adore <br/>
> despise <br/>
> detest <br/>
> can't stand <br/>
> enjoy <br/>

### It + time clause

> I like it when it rains. 💡*Mám rád, když prší.* <br/>
> I love it when she sends me letters. 💡*Miluju, když mi posílá dopisy.* <br/>
> I can't stand it if I hear people talk about her like that. 💡*Nesnášim, když o ní takle lidi mluví.*
> I adore it when she sings. 💡*Zbožňuje, když zpívá*.
> I hate it when he treats me like that. <br/>

### It + conditional clause

> I would like it if you were honest with me. 💡*Byl bych rád, kdybys ke mně byl upřímný.* ➡ I'd like you to be honest
> with
>
me. [object infinitive binding](/topics/parts-of-speech/verbs/non-finite-verb-forms/object-infinitive-binding.md) <br/>
