# Time clauses

## Prepositions

See [time prepositions](/topics/parts-of-speech/preposition/time-prepositions.md).

## Grammar

These clauses determine the time in which the action of the main clause takes place.

### No future tense

We cannot use the future tense in these clauses, we must use the present tense.

> 🔴 When he will come home, he'll make himself some coffee. ➡ 🟢 When he comes home, he'll make himself some
> coffee. <br/>

Not every sentence which begins with the preposition **when** is a time clause.

> I don't know when he will come home. 💡*Object clause, we can use the future tense.* <br/>

### Time sequence

**simple tense + simple tense**

Both actions took place in succession.

> When he saw me, he ran away. 💡*oba děje proběhly po sobě (uviděl mě, a utekl)* <br/>
> He'll be angry when he finds out about it. <br/>

**simple tense + continuous tense**

The action in the simple tense took place during the action in the continuous tense.

> When I called him, he was having breakfast. 💡*děj v prostém čase (já jsem mu zavolal) zasáhl do právě probíhajícího
děje v průběhovém čase (on snídal)* <br/>
> While I was waiting for the bus, somebody stole my wallet. <br/>

**continuous tense + continuous tense**

Both action took place simultaneously.

> When I was working, my children were outside playing football. 💡*oba děje (moje práce i hraní fotbalu) probíhaly
současně* <br/>

**simple tense + perfect tense**

The action in the simple tense took place after the action in the perfect tense.

> When I came to his office, he had already gone. 💡*děj v prostém čase (já jsem přišel k němu do kanceláře) nastal, až
když druhý děj byl dokončen (on odešel), pokud bychom zde použili místo dokonavého času čas prostý, znamenalo by to, že
když jsem tam za ním přišel, on odešel (až když jsem přišel)* <br/>
> I will visit you when you have returned from hospital. <br/>

### Punctuation

See [punctuation](/topics/sentence-structure/punctuation.md).

> He will make himself some coffee when he comes home. 🆚 When he comes home, he will make himself some coffee. <br/>

### Conjunctions

**when** 💡když, až

It can be used in both the present and the continuous tense.

> When I sat down, somebody knocked on the door. <br/>
> When I was having a shower, the cat ate my dinner. <br/>
> When he had completed the task, he was given another. <br/>

**while** 💡zatímco

It is used with the continuous tense.

> I bought a newspaper while I was waiting for the train. <br/>
> While I was skiing, I fell and broke my leg. <br/>

**before, after** 💡předtím než, poté co

They are used with the present tense. **After** can also be use with the perfect tense.

> Before I left home, I switched off the TV. <br/>
> After I switched/had switched off the TV, I left home. <br/>

**until** 💡dokud ne

> She was walking along the street until she realized that she didn't have her wallet. <br/>
> I won't leave until you tell me the truth. <br/>

**as** 💡jak tak, zatímco

It is used with the continuous tense.

> As she was talking to him, her phone rang. ➡ While she was talking ... <br/>

**just as, as soon as** 💡jakmile, hned jak

They are often used with the simple tense. It puts emphasizes that one action took place exactly before the second
one.

> We'll go as soon as it stops raining. <br/>
> Just as he entered the room, everybody started to laugh. <br/>

### Gerund

We can shorten the time clause with the gerund. It can be used only if both clauses have the same subject. It is often
used with the conjunctions **before** and **after**.

> Before he started to read the newspaper, he turned on the radio. ➡ Before starting to read the newspaper, he turned on
> the radio. <br/>
> After he read the newspaper, he got up. ➡ After reading the newspaper, he got up. <br/>

### Participle

See [this article](/topics/parts-of-speech/verbs/non-finite-verb-forms/participle.md).

Again, it is necessary that both clauses have the same subject.

> As soon as I realized that I was late, I started to run. ➡ Realizing that I was late, I started to run. <br/>
> While I was watching the movie, I ate a bag of popcorn. ➡ Watching the movie, I ate a bag of popcorn. <br/>
