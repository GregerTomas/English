# Exclamative clauses

💡 zvolací věty

## Object is noun

If the object of a exclamation is a noun, we can use the adverb **such** or start the exclamation with **what**.

> He's such an idiot! 🔃 What an idiot! <br/>
> It's such a nice movie! 🔃 What a nice movie! <br/>
> It's such a coincidence! 🔃 What a coincidence! <br/>
> You have such big eyes! = What big eyes you have! <br/>
> It's such bad weather today! = What bad weather today! <br/>

In these sentences, **what** is not an interrogative pronoun. We use an announcement word order.

> 🔴 What big eyes do you have! ➡ 🟢 What big eyes you have, Grandma! <br/>
> God, what an idiot he is! <br/>
> Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh. <br/>
> What a beautiful girl he married! <br/>

## Object is adjective or adverb

If the object of a exclamation is an adjective or an adverb, we can use the adverb **so** or start the exclamation
with **how**.

> It's so funny! 🔃 How funny! <br/>
> Oh, it's so nice of you! 🔃 Oh, how nice of you! <br/>
> It's so sad. 🔃 How sad! <br/>

If there is a noun after the adjective, we must use **such** or **what**.

> 🔴 She's so beautiful girl! ➡ 🟢 She's such a beautiful girl! <br/>
> 🔴 How beautiful girl! ➡ 🟢 What a beautiful girl! <br/>

Again, we use announcement word order.

> 🔴 How stupid does it seem now! ➡ 🟢 How stupid it seems now! <br/>
> How happy they look! <br/>

If we use **so much** in the announcement, we can use just **how**.

> Oh, I hate Mondays so much! ➡ Oh, how I hate Mondays! <br/>
> You've changed so much! ➡ How you've changed! <br/>
> I wish you were here right now (so much)! ➡ How I wish you were here right now! <br/>

## Negative sentence with inversion

> Isn't it ironic! <br/>
> Wasn't that nice! <br/>
> Hasn't he changed! <br/>
> Isn't it ironic? Yes, it is. 💡*question* 🆚 Isn't it ironic! 💡*exclamation* <br/>

## Positive sentence with inversion

> Man, was I tired! 💡*Páni, já byl unavený.* <br/>
> Boy, did he bore me! 💡*Páni, ten mě nudil.* <br/>
> My god, am I thirsty! <br/>
> Gee, has she changed! <br/>
> Jesus, did she get mad! <br/>
> Damn, is it hot! <br/>
