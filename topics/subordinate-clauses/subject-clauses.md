# Subject clauses

## Grammar

The subject is often a noun, a noun phrase or a pronoun.

> Dinosaurs are extinct. ðŸ’¡*noun* <br/>
> The old oak tree in the park fell down. ðŸ’¡*noun phrase* <br/>
> I like country music. ðŸ’¡*pronoun* <br/>

We can use a subordinate clause as the subject.

### Wh- clause

> **What surprised me the most** was her height. <br/>
> **Why it happened** is not clear. <br/>
> **What we need** is a miracle. <br/>
> **Whether or not you succeed** depends on you. <br/>
> **Where you found it** doesn't matter. <br/>

We use **whoever** (not **who**) in sentences with the meaning ðŸ’¡*ten, kdo*. Similarly we use **whatever**, but **what**
is also possible.

> Whoever took it will pay. ðŸ’¡*Kdo to ukradl, zaplatÃ­* <br/>
> Whoever gets the most points wins. <br/>
> Whoever doesn't work shouldn't eat. <br/>
> Whatever / What happens happens for a reason. <br/>
> Whatever / What you say can be used against you. <br/>

We can use relative clauses instead of subject clauses.

> Whoever designed this ... âž¡ The person who designed this was probably on drugs. <br/>
> What/Whatever you say ... âž¡ Anything that you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. <br/>
> Whoever sows ... âž¡ "He who sows in tears shall reap in joy," the Bible says. <br/>

### Gerund (infinitive) as subject

We can use the gerund (or even the infinitive) as the subject.

> Talking to people was not her favorite thing to do. <br/>
> Getting good grades requires some effort. <br/>
> Travelling and studying abroad will broaden your horizons. <br/>

You can even encounter the infinitive as the subject, but it is not common. We can replace it with the gerund, or
using **it** as the subject (**anticipatory it**) and moving the infinitive at the end of a sentence.

> To achieve success requires patience and hard work. âž¡ Achieving success requires patience and hard work. <br/>
> To trust the government is silly. âž¡ It's silly to trust the
>
government. [See adjective infinitive binding](/topics/parts-of-speech/verbs/non-finite-verb-forms/adjective-infinitive-binding.md) <br/>
> To get there will take hours. âž¡ It will take hours to get there. <br/>

## Summary

Generally, prefer sentences with the gerund, relative clauses or with **anticipatory it**. Pure object clauses are not
often.

> **anticipatory it** - It's not clear what it means. <br/>
> **relative clause** - Anyone who needs a ride should tell me. <br/>
> **gerund** - Being patient always pays off. <br/>
