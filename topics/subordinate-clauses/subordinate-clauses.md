# Subordinate clauses

## Will in clauses

### Not allowed

There are types of subordinate clauses where we use the present tense to express the future (the future is brought by
the main clause). It applies for following
types of clauses.

| type of clause                                    | conjunctions                                        |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **[time clauses](time-clauses.md)**               | when, while, as soon as, before, after              |
| **[conditional clauses](conditional-clauses.md)** | if, unless, as long as, on condition, provided that |

Sometimes it applies only on particular conjunction, not to the type of clause as a whole.

| conjunctions                                                     | type of clause                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **whoever, whatever**                                            | [subject clauses](subject-clauses.md) / [object clauses](object-clauses.md) |
| **that**, **which**, **who**                                     | [defining relative clauses](relative-clauses.md#defining-relative-clauses)  | 
| **whatever, whenever, whoever, no matter what, no matter where** | [concessive clauses](concessive-clauses.md)                                 |

The future tense can be expressed by a verb in the future tense or by the imperative.

> He will follow her wherever she goes. <br/>
> I'll do whatever you want me to do. <br/>
> We'll see what happens. <br/>
> I'll make sure you never see me again. <br/>
> Will you let me know if you need anything? <br/>
> She'll hate me no matter what I do. <br/>
> He'll be here sooner than I am. <br/>
> Whoever gets there first will get a prize. <br/>
> Students who fail the test will have to take the course again. <br/>
> Call me when you get back. <br/>
> Make sure you don't drop it. <br/>
> I hope they like my project. 🔃 I hope we win! 💡*Both variants are possible.* <br/>

### Allowed

**Will** in the subordinate clause is allowed everywhere where it is not forbidden.

If the main clause is in the present tense, we must use the future tense in the subordinate clause to express the
future. Sometimes the future
in the main clause is not he same as the future in the subordinate clause, then we use the future tense in both clauses.

> **If he was** back in time for dinner ... 💡*conditional clause* 🆚 He didn't tell us **if he would be** back in time
> for dinner. 💡*object clause* <br/>
> **If he gives** me the money, I will buy a new jacket. ... 💡*conditional clause* 🆚 I don't know **if he will give** me
> the money. 💡*object clause* <br/>
> When he gives me the money, I will buy a new jacket. 💡*time clause* 🆚 I don't know when he will give me the money. 💡*
> object clause* <br/>

> I don't know if she will call. <br/>
> He hasn't told us when he will be back. <br/>
> You can choose whether you will or will not be a parent. <br/>
> I'm certain he will be here in time. <br/>
> The psychic will tell us what will happen in our lives. <br/>
> Do it if you will. 💡*Udělej to, jestli chceš. (zde **will** není budoucí čas, ale sloveso)* <br/>

## ✏ Verbless clause

There exists subordinate clauses when there is no subject and verb. There is the **subject complement** (💡*přísudek
jmenný*) right after the conjunction. The **subject complement** is often **an adjective**, **a preposition binding**
or **a noun**.

> If possible it is possbile ... ➡ **If possible**, call someone to let them know that you have arrived home
> safely. <br/>
> **If in doubt**, ask your pharmacist. <br/>
> Avoid the area, **unless absolutely necessary**. <br/>
> **When in Rome**, do as the Romans do. <br/>
> **When ripe**, apples are picked and stored in crates. <br/>
> The gadget should be switched off **as soon as not in use**. <br/>
> **Once free** from her grip, the boy glared at her angrily. <br/>
> Make sure you don't miss it **while in Prague**. <br/>
> **Although not a Christian himself**, he went to church on Sundays to impress the girl he liked. <br/>
> **Though not satisfied** with the results, people were happy the election was over. <br/>
> **Even if not a fan**, I enjoyed the concert. <br/>
> She looked at me **as if utterly unable** to decide what to do. <br/>

> Insert your name **where applicable**. <br/>
> **Whether rich or poor**, he's still the same person. <br/>
