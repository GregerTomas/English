## Partial conversion

Here it is not a complete conversion of one word type into another, but rather one word type fulfilling the function of
another word type in the sentence.

**noun ➡ adjective**

We can place almost every noun before another noun. The first noun then plays the role of the adjective, but it is not
the adjective, so we cannot grade it, use it in the place where adjectives are usually used, use adverbs before it, etc.

> a **school** uniform <br/>
> 🔴 ~~the schoolest uniform~~ <br/>
> 🔴 ~~the uniform was school~~ <br/>
> 🔴 ~~an absolutely school uniform~~ <br/>

> a **music** lesson <br/>
> a **tree** branch <br/>
> a **trip** advisor <br/>
> a **college** degree <br/>
> **Christmas** lights <br/>

**adjective ➡ noun**

These words are not nouns, so we cannot use them in plural. We use them with the definite article.

> the dead 💡*ti mrtví* <br/>
> the blind 💡*ti slepí* <br/>
> the British 💡*Britové* <br/>
> the Spanish 💡*Španělé* <br/>

**present/past participle ➡ adjective**

These words cannot be graded, etc., they are not true adjectives.

> talk ➡ a talking parrot <br/>
> sharpen 💡*nabrousit* ➡ a sharpened knife <br/>

❗Some adjectives (**interesting**, **worried**) were created by full inversion.
