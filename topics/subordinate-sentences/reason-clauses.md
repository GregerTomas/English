# Reason clauses

💡 příčinné (důvodové) věty (proč? / z jakého důvodu? / z jaké příčiny?)

## Conjunctions

### Because

A clause with the conjunction **because** can be used at the beginning, at the end of the sentence or as an answer.

> I called him **because I was worried**. <br/>
> **Because I was worried**, I called him. <br/>
> Why did I call him? **Because I was worried**. <br/>

We often use perfect tenses.

> He was crying because he'd lost his favorite stuffed animal. <br/>
> There was no beer because I'd forgotten to buy it. <br/>
> She had trust issues because she had been betrayed before. <br/>

We can shorten **because** to **cause** or **cos** in 🗣 informal English.

### Since / as

💡 protože

Both conjunctions can be used in time clauses and have another meaning, **since** (💡*od té doby*) and **as**
(💡*jakmile*).

The usage of these conjunctions in reason clauses is ✏ pretty formal and expects that the action in the reason clause is
known to the listener.

> Since you're here, we can discuss the proposal. <br/>
> Since it's late, I'll try to make it short. <br/>
> Since I'm going there anyway, I can give you a ride. <br/>
> As he's failed his final exam, he will have to resit it this fall. <br/>
> As I'm a vegetarian I was happy to see a large selection of vegetarian dishes. <br/>
> As he doesn't have a car, he always rides his bicycle around town. <br/>
> He asked me if he could sleep on my couch as he didn't have the money for a hotel. <br/>
> I'm selling my ticket since I can't go. <br/>

These conjunctions cannot be used in an answer.

> 🔴 Why are you selling your ticket? As I can't go. <br/>
> 🔴 Why are you selling your ticket? Since I can't go. <br/>
> 🟢 Why are you selling your ticket? Because I can't go. <br/>

### 📚 ✏ For

💡 neboť, jelikož

> He was speechless, for he had never seen such a beautiful woman. <br/>
> She would never shed a tear, for she did not want her husband to be even more miserable. <br/>
> Do not worry, for I have other news as well. <br/>
> What he needs is hope, for I'm afraid he's given up. <br/>
> She must have hit her head, for she immediately collapsed afterwards. <br/>

## 📚 ✏ Participle

The reason clause does not have the subject, just a verb in the **ing** form.

> Not knowing what to do, she started crying. <br/>
> Working night shifts, I usually sleep until early afternoon. <br/>
> Having nothing else to do, he went to bed. <br/>
> Being really tired, I went to bed. <br/>
> Having lost her phone, she asked her friend if she could use his. 💡*perfect participle* <br/>

## Replacement

We can express a reason even without the reason clause using an adverbial determination, which starts with a composed
preposition like **because of**, **due to**, **thanks to**, etc.

> It all happened because of you. 💡*Stalo se to všechno kvůli tobě.* <br/>
> The cyclist survived thanks to his helmet. <br/>
> The trip was canceled due to bad weather. <br/>
> Owing to the storm, the schools in the region were closed. <br/>
> On account of recent heavy rains, the river has been temporarily closed to recreation. <br/>

Note that **because** is a conjunction and connects two clauses, and **because of** is a preposition and stands before a
noun.

> I was disappointed because the food wasn't very good. 🆚 I was disappointed because of the food. <br/>
