# Conditional clauses

## Commas

The usage of commas depends on the order of the clauses. If the sentence starts with the conditional clause, we use the
comma, otherwise we do not.

> We'll be late if you don't hurry up. 🆚 If you don't hurry up, we'll be late. <br/>
> He would ask her out, if she were single. 🆚 If she were single, he would ask her out. <br/>

## Conditionals

### Zero conditional

💡 co dělám, když

It is used for the permanent truths. Both clauses are typically in the present tense. We can use either the
conjunction **when** or **if**.

> If / when I'm hungry, I have something to eat. <br/>
> If / when I'm not hungry, I don't eat. <br/>
> We don't play outside if / when it's raining. <br/>
> If / when I need help, I ask for it. <br/>
> Water boils if / when you heat it to 100 degrees. <br/>

### 1st conditional

💡 jestli ... tak ..., když ... tak ..., -li ... tak ...

They are **real and possible** conditions for the present. Something will happen in the future, if the condition is met.

#### Grammar

We use a verb in the present tense in the conditional clause, and the future tense in the main clause (typically **
will**, but even **may** can be used).

We do not use the future tense in the 1st conditional clauses.

> 🔴 If I will have time, I will go there. ➡ 🟢 If I have time, I will go there. 💡*Pokud budu mít čas, půjdu tam.* <br/>
> If the weather is good, I will go out. 💡*Pokud bude dobré počasí, půjdu ven.* <br/>
> If you don't tell me the truth, I will kick you. <br/>
> If I win, I will move abroad. <br/>
> If I see him, I will give him your message. <br/>
> We'll be late if you don't hurry up. <br/>
> If it rains tomorrow, I may stay home. <br/>
> If I stay home, I may lose my job. <br/>

#### Imperative

The future tense is in neither of the clauses.

> Shout if you need anything. <br/>
> If you get lost, call me. <br/>
> If they ask for help, help them. <br/>
> Wear a hat if it snows. <br/>

### 2nd conditional

💡 kdyby ... tak by ... (co by bylo, kdyby)

They are **unreal, theoretical** conditions for the present. The conditions are not met, or are unlikely to be met.

#### Grammar

We use a verb in the past tense in the conditional clause (
or [conjunctive](/topics/parts-of-speech/verbs/conjunctive.md)), and **would** in the main clause.

> If I had the money, I'd buy a car. 💡*Kdybych měl peníze (ale nemám), koupil bych si auto (neočekávám to).<br/>
> If the weather was nice, we'd go on a trip. 💡*Kdyby bylo hezké počasí (ale není / asi nebude), vyrazili bychom na
> výlet (ale asi nevyrazíme).* <br/>
> If we won, we would celebrate. <br/>
> If I needed anything, I would call you. <br/>
> If I were you, I wouldn't trust him. <br/>

Because we can use **conjunctive** in the conditional clause, we can use the verb **were** for all persons.

> If the weather were nice ... 💡*Kdyby bylo hezky* <br/>
> If I were you ... 💡*Kdybych byl tebou* <br/>
> If she were single ... 💡*Kdyby byla svobodná* <br/>

The verb **could** is often used in these clauses, either in the main clause or in the conditional clause.

> If cats **could** talk, they would tell our secrets. <br/>
> If he **could** go anywhere, he would go to Thailand. <br/>
> If it stopped raining, we **could** have a picnic. <br/>
> I **could** buy it for you if it was a little cheaper. <br/>

### 3rd conditional

💡 co by se bývalo stalo (v minulosti), kdyby (v minulosti), hypotetické, teoretické situace v minulosti

💡 v češtině už pro druhý a třetí kondicionál používáme výhradně přítomný podmiňovací způsob (lze použít samozřejmě i
minulý)

They are **unreal,** conditions for the past.

> Kdyby (teď) bylo hezky, šli bychom ven. 💡*přítomná nereálná podmínka, druhý kondicionál* <br/>
> Kdyby (tehdy) bylo hezky, šli bychom ven. 🔃 Kdyby bývalo hezky, byli bychom šli ven. 💡*minulá nereálná podmínka, třetí
> kondicionál* <br/>

#### Grammar

We use **had + past participle** in the conditional clause, and **would + perfect infitnitive** in the main clause.

> If you had listened to me, you wouldn't have had to pay the fine. 💡*Kdybys mě (býval) poslechl, nemusel jsi (býval)
platit.* <br/>
> If I had bought a better phone, it wouldn't have broken. 💡*Kdybych si (býval) koupil lepší telefon, (býval) by se
nerozbil.* <br/>
> If I had asked for directions, I would have arrived sooner. 💡*Kdybych se (býval) zeptal, dorazil bych (býval)
dříve.* <br/>
> If she hadn't cheated, it wouldn't have happened to her. 💡*Kdyby (bývala) nepodváděla, (bývalo) by se jí to
nestalo.* <br/>
> If I hadn't been unlucky, I would have passed the exam. <br/>
> If he had finished his studies, he would have become a teacher. <br/>
> You would have caught the bus if you had left the house earlier. <br/>
> They wouldn't have gotten wet in the rain if they had taken a taxi. <br/>
> The dog wouldn't have bitten him if he hadn't broken into our garden. <br/>
> She wouldn't have entered the beauty contest if her friends hadn't talked her into it. <br/>
> They would have won if the opponent hadn't cheated. <br/>
> She would have died if they hadn't taken her to the hospital. <br/>
> I would have worn a suit and tie if they had told me it was a formal party. <br/>
> If you had told me about the problem sooner, I would have been able to help you. <br/>

#### Pronunciation

In the 🗣 spoken English, following words are pronounced shortly.

| word  | full pronunciation | reduced pronunciation |
|-------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| had	  | /hæd/	             | /əd/                  |
| would | 	/wʊd/	            | /wəd/                 |
| have  | 	/hæv/	            | /əv/                  |

### Mixed conditionals

We can mix 2nd a 3rd conditional together in two ways.

#### Condition in the past, result in the present

We take the conditional clause from the 3rd conditional, and the main clause from the 2nd conditional.

> If I hadn't met my wife, I wouldn't have such a beautiful family. 💡*Kdybych býval nepotkal svoji ženu (v minulosti),
neměl bych tak krásnou rodinu (nyní).* <br/>
> If I had studied more when I was young, I would certainly have a better job now. 💡*Kdybych se býval v mládí lépe
učil (tehdy), měl bych nyní lepší práci (nyní).* <br/>
> If I had had breakfast, I wouldn't be hungry now. <br/>

#### Condition in the present, result in the past

The condition is related to a permanent truth (i.e., the present). We take the conditional clause from the 2nd
conditional, and the main clause from the 3rd conditional.

> If I wasn't lazy, I would have helped them. 💡*Kdybych nebyl tak líný (pro přítomnost používáme minulý čas), býval bych
jim pomohl (tehdy).* <br/>
> If she wasn't so pretty, I would have never fallen in love with her. 💡*Kdyby nebyla tak pěkná (stále – i nyní – proto
minulý čas), nikdy bych se do ní nebyl zamiloval (týká se to minulosti – já se do ní zamiloval).* <br/>
> If I liked pizza, I would have gone to the pizzeria with you. <br/>
