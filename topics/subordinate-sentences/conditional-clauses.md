# Conditional clauses

## Commas

The usage of commas depends on the order of the clauses. If the sentence starts with the conditional clause, we use the
comma, otherwise we do not.

> We'll be late if you don't hurry up. 🆚 If you don't hurry up, we'll be late. <br/>
> He would ask her out, if she were single. 🆚 If she were single, he would ask her out. <br/>

## Conditionals

### 1st conditional

💡 jestli ... tak ..., když ... tak ..., -li ... tak ...

They are **real and possible** conditions for the present. Something will happen in the future, if the condition is met.

#### Grammar

We do not use the future tense in the 1st conditional clauses.

> 🔴 If I will have time, I will go there. ➡ 🟢 If I have time, I will go there. 💡*Pokud budu mít čas, půjdu tam.* <br/>
> If the weather is good, I will go out. 💡*Pokud bude dobré počasí, půjdu ven.* <br/>
> If you don't tell me the truth, I will kick you. <br/>
> If I win, I will move abroad. <br/>
> If I see him, I will give him your message. <br/>
> We'll be late if you don't hurry up. <br/>

#### Imperative

The future tense is in neither of the clauses.

> Shout if you need anything. <br/>
> If you get lost, call me. <br/>
> If they ask for help, help them. <br/>
> Wear a hat if it snows. <br/>

### 2nd conditional

💡 kdyby ... tak by ... (co by bylo, kdyby)

They are **unreal** conditions for the present. The conditions are not met, or are unlikely to be met.

#### Grammar

We use a verb in the past tense in the conditional clause (
or [conjunctive](/topics/parts-of-speech/verbs/conjunctive.md)), and **would** in the main clause.

> If I had the money, I'd buy a car. 💡*Kdybych měl peníze, koupil bych si auto.<br/>
> If the weather was nice, we'd go on a trip. 💡*Kdyby bylo hezké počasí, vyrazili bychom na výlet.* <br/>
> If we won, we would celebrate. <br/>
> If I needed anything, I would call you. <br/>
> If I were you, I wouldn't trust him. <br/>

Because we can use **conjunctive** in the conditional clause, we can use the verb **were** for all persons.

> If the weather were nice ... 💡*Kdyby bylo hezky* <br/>
> If I were you ... 💡*Kdybych byl tebou* <br/>
> If she were single ... 💡*Kdyby byla svobodná* <br/>

The verb **could** is often used in these clauses, either in the main clause or in the conditional clause.

> If cats **could** talk, they would tell our secrets. <br/>
> If he **could** go anywhere, he would go to Thailand. <br/>
> If it stopped raining, we **could** have a picnic. <br/>
> I **could** buy it for you if it was a little cheaper. <br/>
