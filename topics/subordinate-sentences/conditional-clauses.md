# Conditional clauses

## Commas

The usage of commas depends on the order of the clauses. If the sentence starts with the conditional clause, we use the
comma, otherwise we do not.

> We'll be late if you don't hurry up. 🆚 If you don't hurry up, we'll be late. <br/>
> He would ask her out, if she were single. 🆚 If she were single, he would ask her out. <br/>

## Conditionals

### 1st conditional

💡 jestli ... tak ..., když ... tak ..., -li ... tak ...

They are **real and possible** conditions for the present. Something will happen in the future, if the condition is met.

#### Grammar

We do not use the future tense in the 1st conditional clauses. The whole sentence can be even in past tense.

> 🔴 If I will have time, I will go there. ➡ 🟢 If I have time, I will go there. 💡*Pokud budu mít čas, půjdu tam.* <br/>
> If the weather is good, I will go out. 💡*Pokud bude dobré počasí, půjdu ven.* <br/>
> If you don't tell me the truth, I will kick you. <br/>
> If I win, I will move abroad. <br/>
> If I see him, I will give him your message. <br/>
> We'll be late if you don't hurry up. <br/>
> If it rained, they probably stayed at home.💡*Jestli pršelo, zůstali pravděpodobně doma.* <br/>

#### Imperative

The future tense is in neither of the clauses.

> Shout if you need anything. <br/>
> If you get lost, call me. <br/>
> If they ask for help, help them. <br/>
> Wear a hat if it snows. <br/>

#### Mixed conditionals

We can combine different tenses in the sentence. Only one rule applies, the future tense cannot be used in the
conditional clause. See some examples bellow, other tenses are also possible.

**conditional in past + result in future**

> If she missed her bus this morning, she will be late. 💡*Je možné, že jí ujel autobus, v tom případě přijde pozdě. A
jestli jí neujel, potom asi přijde včas.* <br/>

**conditional in present + result in future**

> If she's lying, I won't talk to her again. 💡*Možná lže, možná nelže, ale jestli ano (ta možnost tu je), už s ní
nepromluvím.* <br/>

**conditional in present + result in past**

> If he's not on holiday, he lied to us! 💡*Je možné že není na dovolené, a jestli ne, potom nám lhal. Je tedy možné, že
nám lhal.* <br/>

#### Alternative conditionals

##### Unless

💡 jestli ne, pokud ne

It is equal to **if not**.

> I won't help you unless you help me. 🔃 if you don't help me. <br/>
> We'll go out unless she's too busy. 🔃 if she isn't too busy. <br/>

##### Provided, providing (that)

💡 za předpokladu, že

> I'll take the job **provided they offer me a good salary. <br/>
> I'll take the job **providing (that)** they offer me a good salary. <br/>

##### On condition (that)

💡 pod podmínkou, že

> I'll tell you a secret **on condition (that)** you don't tell anyone. <br/>

##### As long as

💡 pokud

It can also be used in the time clauses (💡*dokud*).

> I like spending weekends with my parents **as long as** they don't start trying to talk me into getting married and
> settling down.

### 2nd conditional

💡 kdyby ... tak by ... (co by bylo, kdyby)

They are **unreal, theoretical** conditions for the present. The conditions are not met, or are unlikely to be met.

#### Grammar

We use a verb in the past tense in the conditional clause (
or [conjunctive](/topics/parts-of-speech/verbs/conjunctive.md)), and **would** in the main clause.

> If I had the money, I'd buy a car. 💡*Kdybych měl peníze (ale nemám), koupil bych si auto (neočekávám to).<br/>
> If the weather was nice, we'd go on a trip. 💡*Kdyby bylo hezké počasí (ale není / asi nebude), vyrazili bychom na
> výlet (ale asi nevyrazíme).* <br/>
> If we won, we would celebrate. <br/>
> If I needed anything, I would call you. <br/>
> If I were you, I wouldn't trust him. <br/>

Because we can use **conjunctive** in the conditional clause, we can use the verb **were** for all persons.

> If the weather were nice ... 💡*Kdyby bylo hezky* <br/>
> If I were you ... 💡*Kdybych byl tebou* <br/>
> If she were single ... 💡*Kdyby byla svobodná* <br/>

The verb **could** is often used in these clauses, either in the main clause or in the conditional clause.

> If cats **could** talk, they would tell our secrets. <br/>
> If he **could** go anywhere, he would go to Thailand. <br/>
> If it stopped raining, we **could** have a picnic. <br/>
> I **could** buy it for you if it was a little cheaper. <br/>

### 3rd conditional

💡 co by se bývalo stalo (v minulosti), kdyby (v minulosti), hypotetické, teoretické situace v minulosti

💡 v češtině už pro druhý a třetí kondicionál používáme výhradně přítomný podmiňovací způsob (lze použít samozřejmě i
minulý)

> Kdyby (teď) bylo hezky, šli bychom ven. 💡*přítomná nereálná podmínka, druhý kondicionál* <br/>
> Kdyby (tehdy) bylo hezky, šli bychom ven. 🔃 Kdyby bývalo hezky, byli bychom šli ven. 💡*minulá nereálná podmínka, třetí
> kondicionál* <br/>

#### Grammar

We use **had + past participle** in the conditional clause, and **would + perfect infitnitive** in the main clause.

> If you had listened to me, you wouldn't have had to pay the fine. 💡*Kdybys mě (býval) poslechl, nemusel jsi (býval)
platit.* <br/>
> If I had bought a better phone, it wouldn't have broken. 💡*Kdybych si (býval) koupil lepší telefon, (býval) by se
nerozbil.* <br/>
> If I had asked for directions, I would have arrived sooner. 💡*Kdybych se (býval) zeptal, dorazil bych (býval)
dříve.* <br/>
> If she hadn't cheated, it wouldn't have happened to her. 💡*Kdyby (bývala) nepodváděla, (bývalo) by se jí to
nestalo.* <br/>
> If I hadn't been unlucky, I would have passed the exam. <br/>
> If he had finished his studies, he would have become a teacher. <br/>
> You would have caught the bus if you had left the house earlier. <br/>
> They wouldn't have gotten wet in the rain if they had taken a taxi. <br/>
> The dog wouldn't have bitten him if he hadn't broken into our garden. <br/>
> She wouldn't have entered the beauty contest if her friends hadn't talked her into it. <br/>
> They would have won if the opponent hadn't cheated. <br/>
> She would have died if they hadn't taken her to the hospital. <br/>
> I would have worn a suit and tie if they had told me it was a formal party. <br/>
> If you had told me about the problem sooner, I would have been able to help you. <br/>
