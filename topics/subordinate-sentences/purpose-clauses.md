# Purpose clauses

💡 účelové věty (proč? / za jakým účelem?)

## Purpose of things

We can use either **for + -ing** or **infinitive + to**. for expressing the purpose of things.

> A cup is for drinking out of. 💡*Šálek je k tomu, aby se z něj pilo.* <br/>
> An oven is for cooking things in. 💡*Trouba je na pečení.* <br/>
> A plastic bag is for carrying your shopping in. <br/>
> It's good for nothing. <br/>
> What is it for? <br/>
> It's a machine to wash your clothes in. <br/>
> You use it to open tins with. <br/>

## Infinitive of purpose

We can use either **in order (not) to + infinitive** or **so as (not) to + infinitive** (✏ formal) to say the purpose of
some action. It is necessary both actions have the same subject.

> I went out in order to buy some bread. <br/>
> I work hard in order to be rich and famous. <br/>
> He goes to the fitness center in order to look like Arnold. <br/>
> I get up early in order not to be late. <br/>
> ✏ We always get up early so as to get to work in time. <br/>
> ✏ She always writes down people's names so as not to forget them. <br/>
> 🔴 He called them in order to wait for him. 💡*Subjects are not the same.* <br/>

🗣 In spoken English we can omit **in order** or **so as**, only the **infinitive of purpose** remains. It is not often
possible in negative sentences.

> I went out in order to buy some bread. ➡ I went out to buy some bread. <br/>
> I work hard in order to be rich and famous. ➡ I work hard to be rich and famous. <br/>
> He goes to the fitness center in order to look like Arnold. ➡ He goes to the fitness to look like Arnold. <br/>
> ✏ We always get up early so as to get to work in time. ➡ We get up early to get to work in time. <br/>
> 🔴 I get up early not to be late. ➡ 🟢 I get up early in order not to be late. <br/>

## Purpose clauses

We use them if subjects of the action and of the purpose are different. We use phrase **so that**, or very formal ✏ **in
order that**. There is often used a modal verb in the purpose clause.

If the main clause is in the present or the future tense, we use a verb in the present tense in the purpose clause. If
the main clause is in the past, we use a verb in the past tense in the purpose clause.

> I'll get up early **so that** I can be there on time. <br/>
> I got up early **so that** I wouldn't be late for school. <br/>

**So that** can be shortened to **so** in 🗣 informal English as well.

> I'll get up early **so** I can be there on time. <br/>

### Usage

#### Different subjects

> They hid the eggs in the garden carelessly so that the children could easily find them. <br/>
> I told her my phone number so that she could call me. <br/>
> I spoke loudly so that everybody could hear me. <br/>

#### Negative purposes

Even though the sentences have the same subject, we can avoid the bit complicated phrase **in order no to**.

> I set the alarm clock for 6 am so that I wouldn't miss the bus. <br/>
> Put your wallet in your bag so that you won't lose it. <br/>
> She usually writes down people's names so that she doesn't forget them. <br/>

#### With modal verb

Even though the sentences have the same subject, we can avoid the bit complicated phrase **in order no to**.

> I opened the window so that I could see the parade better. <br/>
> I'm going to attend the course so that I can learn more about the power of human brain. <br/>

### Purpose clauses 🆚 infinitive of purpose

In general, we prefer the infinitive of purpose to purpose clauses, which are not so often in 🗣 informal English.

> I opened the door **so that** they **could** get in. 🔃 I opened the door **for them to** get in. <br/>
> I work **so that** my family **can** have enough money. 🔃 I work **to earn** enough money for my family. <br/>
