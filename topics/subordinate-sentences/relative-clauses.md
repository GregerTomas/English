# Relative clauses

## Categories

### Defining relative clauses

These clauses determine the noun (pronoun). The sentence does not make sense if you omit the relative clause.

> The writer who wrote "The Grapes of Wrath" is my favourite author. <br/>
> The house where we live is very old. <br/>
> A pilot is a man who flies a plane. <br/>

### Non-defining relative clauses

These clauses just add additional information about the noun (pronoun). They can be omitted.

> John Steinbeck, who wrote "The Grapes of Wrath", is my favourite author. <br/>
> Our house, where we have lived for ten years, is very old. <br/>
> Captain John Chang, who is flying the plane today, is a highly experienced pilot. <br/>

## Grammar

These clauses determine a noun (pronoun), they give additional information about the noun (pronoun), and are placed
directly after the noun (pronoun).

| topic                     | defining    | non-defining |
|---------------------------|-------------|--------------|
| using **that**            | possible    | not possible |
| commas                    | aren't used | are used     |
| omitting relative pronoun | possible    | not possible |

❗The pronoun **what** is not a relative pronoun.

### Relative clauses

#### Who

💡 který

It is used with animate nouns. We can use **that** instead it in the defining clauses. You can encounter **whom** in old
English.

> My father, **who** is an economist, studied at Charles University. <br/>
> The man **who** told me the way was very polite. <br/>
> The man **that** told me the way was very polite. <br/>
> The man **whom** we met in the street today was my friend's father. ➡ The man **who** we met in the street today was
> my friend's father. <br/>

#### Which

💡 který

It is used with inanimate nouns. We can use **that** instead it in the defining clauses.

> My new guitar, **which** I bought yesterday, is excellent. <br/>
> The building **which** stands next to our house is very nice. <br/>
> The building **that** stands next to our house is very nice.


ℹ **Which** for animate nouns is possible as an interrogative pronoun (not as a relative pronoun).

> 🟢 Which boy did it? <br/>
> 🔴 The boy which did it will be punished. <br/>

### That

**That** can replace **who** or **which** in the defining relative clauses. It is also used with nouns like **
something**, **nothing** or **anything** (**which** is used with these nouns very rarely).

> 🟢 He said something that I liked. ➡ He said something I liked. 💡Řekl něco, co se mi líbilo.* <br/>
> 🔴 He said something what I liked. <br/>

#### Whose

💡 jehož, jejíž

It is used with both animate and inanimate nouns. We can encounter **of which** in old or formal English.

> The child whose picture was the best got an award. <br/>
> The tree, whose branches were all dry, had to be cut down. <br/>
> The tree, the branches of which were all dry, had to be cut down. ➡ The tree, whose branches were all dry, had to be
> cut down. <br/>

#### Where

> The house where I live is small. <br/>
> Stratford on Avon, where Shakespeare was born, is pretty nice city. <br/>

#### When

> The weekends when I don't have to go to work are the best. 💡*The clause determines the noun **weekends**, therefore it
is the relative clause and not the time clause* <br/>

#### Why

> That's the reason why I do it. 💡*The clause determines the noun **reason**, therefore it
is the relative clause* <br/>

#### 🔴 ~~What~~

**What** is not a relative pronoun.

> 🔴 The book what I bought is not very good. ➡ 🟢 The book which I bought is not very good. <br/>

ℹ It can be used in the [object clauses](object-clauses.md), but cannot be used in the relative clauses.

> Tell me what I want to hear. <br/>
> Tell me something that I want to hear. <br/>

### Commas

We use them with **defining clauses**. We don't with **non-defining clauses**.

> The book which I bought is not very good. <br/>
> Grapes of Wrath, which I've just finished, is an excellent book. <br/>

### Omission of relative pronoun

We can omit a relative pronoun in the **defining clauses** where the pronoun does not behave as the subject.

> The book which I bought is not very good. ➡ The book I bought is not very good. <br/>
> The stone which fell on my head was quite big. 🔴 The stone fell on my head was quite big. <br/>

### Participle

See [this article](/topics/parts-of-speech/verbs/non-finite-verb-forms/participle.md#relative-clauses).

### How and relative clauses

**How** cannot be used as a relative pronoun. We can use phrases **way to do sth**, **way of doing sth**, **way (that)**
.

> 🔴 It's the best way **how** to learn English. <br/>
> ➡ 🟢 It's the best way to learn English. <br/>
> ➡ 🟢 It's the best way of learning English. <br/>
> ➡ 🟢 It's the best way (that) you can learn English. <br/>
> 💡*Je to nejlepší způsob, jak se můžeš naučit anglicky.* <br/>

**way to do sth**

> What's the best **way to learn** Spanish? <br/>
> There are other **ways to lose** weight, you know. <br/>
> This is not the only **way to write** an essay, though. <br/>
> What's the easiest **way to make** some money? <br/>

**way of doing sth**

> They claim to have discovered a new **way of learning** languages. <br/>
> It's the safest **way of storing** data online. <br/>
> For her, singing is a **way of honoring** God. <br/>
> Gardening was a **way of relaxing** for Roger. <br/>

**way (that)**

> He showed me the **way (that)** he learns new vocabulary. <br/>
> There are other **ways (that)** you can say the same thing. <br/>
> That's the **way (that)** we do it. <br/>
> "Maturity, the **way (that)** I understand it, is knowing what your limitations are." <br/>

### Object clauses

We cannot use **how** as a relative pronoun, but we can use it in the object clauses.

> I don't know how I should feel about it. <br/>

It can even be used after a preposition, so we can replace a relative clause with **a preposition + an object clause**.
Prepositions **on** nad **of** are often used.

**preposition on**

> 🔴 It's a **question how** you want to live your life. ➡ 🟢 It's a **question of how** you want to live your life. <br/>
> 🔴 Here are some **tips how** you can learn English. ➡ 🟢 Here are some **tips on how** you can learn English. <br/>
> He gave me some **advice on how** to lose weight. <br/>
> This book includes a simple **tutorial on how** to set up your website. <br/>
> I need more **instructions on how** to work in Photoshop. <br/>
> He has a **plan on how** he can achieve his goals. <br/>

**preposition of**

> 🔴 It's a **description how** the system works. ➡ 🟢 It's a **description of how** the system works. <br/>
> Can you give me an **example of how** to write an essay in English? <br/>
> He brought up the **question of how** to handle the case. <br/>
> The book touches on the **issue of how** people can help saving the planet. <br/>

These nouns would be used with a preposition even with other relative adverbs.

> 🔴 He gave me some **tips where** to stay in Dublin. ➡ 🟢 He gave me some **tips on where** to stay in Dublin. <br/>
> 🔴 It was a **question when** someone would find out about it. ➡ 🟢 It was a **question of when** someone would find out
> about it. <br/>

### Summary

The adverb **how** cannot be used after a noun, so following example are wrong:

> 🔴 way how <br/>
> 🔴 advice how <br/>
> 🔴 tips how <br/>
> 🔴 instructions how <br/>
