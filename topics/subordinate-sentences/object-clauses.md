# Object clauses

## Grammar

These clauses replace the object of a sentence.

> I don't know his name. ➡ I don't know what his name is. <br/>
> He believes in God. ➡ He believes that there is a God. <br/>

### Comma

We do not use the comma in these clauses.

> 🔴 I don't know, his name. <br/>
> 🔴 I don't know, what his name is. <br/>

### Omitting that

> She said **that** she was hungry. ➡ She said she was hungry. <br/>
> I know **that** you like football. ➡ I know you like football. <br/>

### Will after if and when

In opposite to time and conditional clauses, we can use **will** after the conjunctions **if** and **when**.

> We will have dinner when you come. 💡*time clause* 🆚 I don't know when you will come. 💡*object clause* <br/>
> We will go out if we have the time. 💡*conditional clause* 🆚 I don't know if we will have the time. 💡*object
clause* <br/>

### Question word order

**not a question**
> Where are you? 🆚 🔴 I don't know where are you. ➡ 🟢 I don't know where you are. <br/>
> What's your name? 🆚 🔴 I don't know what's your name. ➡ 🟢 I don't know what your name is. <br/>
> What time did you get up? 🆚 🔴 I don't know what time did you get up. ➡ 🟢 I don't know what time you got up. <br/>

**the main clause behaves as a question, the subordinate clause doesn't**
> Where is the station? 🆚 🔴 Could you tell me where is the station? ➡ 🟢 Could you tell me where the station is? <br/>
> Where does he live? 🆚 🔴 Do you know where does he live? ➡ 🟢 Do you know where he lives? <br/>

### Prepositions

Prepositions are used at the end of a sentence. The same rule applies for [interrogative](⏳todo) and [relational](⏳todo)
clauses.

> I don't know **what** you are talking **about**. <br/>
> Tell me **what** you are looking **at**. <br/>

### Tense shift

The same rules which are used in the [indirect speech](⏳TODO) apply here.

> He didn't know what I was doing. 💡*Nevěděl, co dělám. (přítomný čas ➡ minulý čas)* <br/>
