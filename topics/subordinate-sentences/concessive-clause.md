# Concessive clause

💡 přípustkové věty (přestože, i když, ačkoliv), něco tvrdíme, ale připouštíme něco jiného

## Although, though, even though

💡 ačkoliv, ač, i když

These words are conjunctions and stands before the concessive clause. **Though** means the same as **although** and is
more common in 🗣 informal English. **Even though** emphasize the
contradiction of both information.

> **Although** I hadn't eaten anything all day, I wasn't hungry. <br/>
> I didn't pass the test **even though** I had studied all night. <br/>
> She bought the coat **though** it was quite expensive. <br/>
> He helped me although he was very busy. 🆚 He helped me even though he was very busy. <br/>

### Even though 🆚 even if

See also [emphasize a conjunctions](/topics/parts-of-speech/conjunctions/conjunctions.md#emphasize-a-conjunction).

> **even if** - conditional clause (very close to concessive clause) <br/>
> **even though** - concessive clause <br/>

We use **even though** when we know that it is, was, or will be. On the other hand, we use **even if** when we don't
know if it will be, was or is, we just say what would be.

> Even if I wanted ... 💡*i kdybych chtěl (ale nechci)*
> 🆚 <br/>
> Even though I wanted ... 💡*i když jsem chtěl (opravdu jsem chtěl)* <br/>

> Even if you help me ... 💡*i když mi pomůžeš (nevím, jestli mi pomůžeš)* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> Even though you help me ... 💡*i když mi pomáháš (pomáháš mi)* <br/>

## Despite, in spite of

💡 navzdory, i přes

**Despite** is rather ✏ formal and is used in written English, and **in spite of** is informal and is used in 🗣 spoken
English.

These words are prepositions and stand before a noun, pronoun or gerund.

> 🔴 Despite it was raining, we went to the zoo. ➡ 🟢 Despite the rain, we went to the zoo. <br/>
> 🔴 In spite of he was tired, he decided to help me. ➡ 🟢 In spite of being tired, he decided to help me. <br/>

If we want to use gerund, subject in the main and subordinate clause must be the same. Otherwise, we can use phrase **
despite the fact that** or **in spite of the fact that**.
> Although it was really cold, Josh went snowboarding. <br/>
> ❌ Despite being cold, Josh went snowboarding. 💡*Zde bychom automaticky předpokládali, že podmět hlavní věty je zároveň
podmětem gerundia, tedy že JEMU (Joshovi) BYLA VELKÁ ZIMA. Tak to ale nebylo.* <br/>
> ➡ In spite of the fact that it was raining, we went to the zoo. 💡*too long for spoken English, used rather in written
English* <br/>

## However

💡 ale, však, avšak

It is not used for connecting two sentences (does not stand before the concessive clause), but it stands before a simple
sentence. In fact, it is not a conjunction but an adverb. It is separated with commas from the rest of the sentence.

> **Although** it was raining, we went to the zoo. 🆚 It was raining. **However**, we went to the zoo. <br/>
> I liked the film. My mother, **however**, didn't like it at all. <br/>

It has the same meaning as ordinary **but**, but punctuation is different. In 🗣 spoken English. we can also use **
though**, but it must be used at the end of the sentence.

> It was raining**, but** I went for a walk. 🆚 It was raining. **However,** I went for a walk. <br/>
> I love the film. My mother doesn't like it, though. <br/>
