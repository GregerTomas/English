# Word order

<hr/>

## Announcement sentence

We use the following word order in announcement sentences (**SVOMPT**).

* subject
* verb
* object
* manner
* place
* time

We can switch adverbial determinations of **place** and **manner** in established phrases.
> He went to school very quickly. <br/>

We can also put an adverbial determination at the beginning of a sentence (potentially separated by a comma).
> On Fridays, I usually go to work at 9. <br/>
> Tomorrow I am staying at home. <br/>

<hr/>

## Adverbs

There are two types of adverbs: **frequency / measurement** and **manner**.

### Frequency and measurement

This category includes adverbs like: often, always, usually, never, hardly ever, ...

We use these adverbs before a main verb but after the *be* verb. In case of multiple verbs, adverbs are used after
auxiliary verb and before the main one.

> I often go there. <br/>
> She is always busy. <br/>
> I have never been there. <br/>
> I am never late. <br/>

### Manner

This category includes adverbs like: correctly, well, ...

We use these adverbs after the main verb.

> He spelled the name correctly. <br/>
> He does not sleep well. <br/>

It is possible to use this type of adverb at the beginning of the sentence. It gives a context related to the speaker (
however, firstly, suddenly, ...)
> Suddenly, I heard something. <br/>

<hr/>

## Adjectives

An adjective can be placed in two possible places: **before a noun** or **after the verb**.

Notice that an adjective can have multiple meanings.
> It happened in late December. <br/>
> He was late again. <br/>
> He likes his late wife. <br/>

### Before a noun

An adjective serve as a noun determination.
This category containers following adjectives: only, particular (ðŸ’¡*konkrÃ©tnÃ­*), main, past, future, former, pure, mere (
ðŸ’¡*pouhÃ½*), ...

> He is an old man. <br/>
> The movie which we saw yesterday was amazing. <br/>
> That is utter nonsense. <br/>
> I believe that I passed by pure luck. <br/>
> She is my former and future wife. <br/>

### After the verb

We put adjectives after verbs like:

* be, seem, appear, become, ...
* with **a-** prefix: awake, alive, asleep, alone, afraid, ...

> I am awake. <br/>
> He fell asleep. <br/>

<hr/>

## Two subjects

It is possible to have two subjects in one sentence: **direct subject** (*co*) and **indirect subject** (*komu*).

There are two possible ways how to use them together.

### Indirect subject followed by direct subject

Not possible if a direct subject is a pronoun.
> I give him a gift. <br/>
> He gave me a book. <br/>

### Direct subject + to/for + indirect subject

> I give it to him. <br/>
> I give a gift to him. <br/>

We are able to express passive as follows.
> A gift was given to me. âž¡ I was given a gift.

### Which type to use

We have two possibilities.

#### End focus

We put the most important part of the sentence at the end.

> Give my mother **a present**. <br/>
> Give a present **to my mother**. <br/>
> Give the black book I bought you last week **to me**. <br/>

#### End weight

We put a more difficult (or longer) part of the sentence at the end.

> Give me **the black book I bought you last week**. <br/>
