💡 tak ... jak ...

> I'm not **as tall as** you. <br/>

> Patrik can run **as fast as** David. <br/>
> I'm not **as good as** you. <br/>
> I didn't want to wait **as long as** you. <br/>

We can use after this phrase the **object form of a pronoun (🗣 informal)** or the **subject form + verb (✏ formal)**.

> 🔴 He doesn't speak English as well as I. <br/>
> 🗣 He doesn't speak English as well as me. <br/>
> ✏ He doesn't speak English as well as I do. <br/>

> 🔴 You aren't as tall as he. <br/>
> 🗣 You aren't as tall as him. <br/>
> ✏ You aren't as tall as he is. <br/>

> 🗣 She's as tall as you. <br/>
> ✏ She's as tall as you are. <br/>

We can use even the whole clause after this phrase.

> It wasn't as difficult as I expected. <br/>
> My English is not as good as it was ten years ago. <br/>
> You can invite as many friends as you want. <br/>
> You should try as hard as you can. <br/>

> I don't clean the house as often as I should. <br/>
> Have some more beer. You can drink as much as you want. <br/>
> I can spend as much money as I want. <br/>

In negative sentences, we can face **so** instead of **as**, but it is really rare.

> Your car isn't so good as mine. 💡*really rare* ➡ Your car isn't as good as mine. <br/>

We can use a noun with this phrase, but an indefinite article must be moved.

> He's a tall man. ➡ He's **as tall a man** as his father was. <br/>
> We have a large garden. ➡ We have **as large a garden** as you do. <br/>
