# Grading

There are 3 forms:

* **basic form**
* **comparative** 💡*We use it for comparing things.*
* **superlative** 💡*We select one thing from a collection which is best based on a concrete property.*

## Short adjectives

They usually consist of one syllable (e.g. **nice**, **big**, **green**, **slow**, **quick**, **small**). two-syllable
adjectives ending in **-y** (**happy**, **funny**, **healthy**, **pretty**) and some two-syllable (**yellow**, **
hollow**, **clever**, **stupid**).

Suffixes **-er** and **-est** are used for gradation.

| basic form	 | comparative | superlative |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| slow        | 	slower     | 	slowest    | 
| nice        | nicer       | 	nicest     |
| big         | bigger      | biggest     |
| happy       | 	happier    | happiest    |

### Grammar changes

**adjectives ending with -e** - only one **-e**

> 🔴 niceer ➡ 🟢 nicer <br/>

**adjectives ending with *consonant + vowel + consonant*** - doubled consonant

> big ➡ bigger <br/>
> thin ➡ thinner <br/>
> hot ➡ hotter <br/>

**adjectives ending with -y** - exchange from **-y** to **-i**

> funny ➡ funnier <br/>
> dry ➡ drier <br/>

## Long adjectives

They usually consist of two or more syllables. Adverbs **more** and **most** are used for gradation.

| basic form	 | comparative      | superlative      |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| interesting | more interesting | most interesting |
| beautiful   | 	more beautiful  | 	most beautiful  |
| useful      | more useful      | most useful      |

| bad                       | worse                              | 	worst                                  |
| far 💡*vzdálený, DalekJS* | 	farther / further 💡*vzdálenější* | 	farthest / furthest 💡*nejvzdálenější* |    
| little 💡*malý*           | lesser 💡*menší, méně závažný*     | 	least 💡*nejmenší, nejméně závažný*    | 

## Ungradable adjectives

Some adjectives cannot be graded, for example [extreme adjectives](adjectives-examples.md#extreme-adjectives) or
adjectives like **broken**, **boiling**, **perfect**, etc.

## Use

### Comparative

It is used from comparison of two things, very often used with the preposition **than**.

> Mark is taller than John. <br/>
> Books are better than movies. <br/>
> Japanese is more difficult than Spanish. <br/>
> I heard that dolphins are more intelligent than humans. Is it true? <br/>

We can adjust the meaning with words like **far, much, a lot, way** or  **a little, a bit**.

> Cats are far more intelligent than dogs. <br/>
> That's much better. Well done! <br/>
> The problem was a lot worse than we first thought. <br/>
> Jake's dad is way cooler than you! <br/>
> I feel a little better today. <br/>
> This movie was a bit more interesting than the one we saw last week. <br/>

We use the object form of a pronoun (or even the subject form, but it is not recommended) when we use **than + pronoun**
, and the subject form
when we use **than + pronoun + verb**.

> 🔴 You're taller than **he**. ➡ 🟢 You're taller than **him**. <br/>
> You're taller than he is. 🔃 You're taller than him. <br/>
> You look better than I do. 🔃 You look better than me. <br/>

Rules for determiners apply as usual.

> You'll need a better computer. <br/>
> Both books are good, but this one is better. <br/>
> Choose the better option. <br/>

### Superlative

It is used from comparison of more than two things in order to select the best one, therefore we use the definitive
article. Never ever we can use a possessive pronoun together with the definite article.

> This is the best thing I've ever eaten! <br/>
> The fastest swimmer will get a prize. <br/>
> He always buys the most expensive shoes. <br/>
> Thanks! You're the best! <br/>
> 🔴 He's **my the best** friend. ➡ 🟢 He's **my best** friend. <br/>
> 🔴 "The Da Vinci Code" is **his the most** popular novel. ➡ 🟢 "The Da Vinci Code" is **his most** popular novel. <br/>

We often use the preposition **of** together with **superlative**. If we select the best thing in a place, group, etc.,
we use a place preposition like **in** or **on**.

> He's the tallest of the three of us. <br/>
> 🔴 She's the most beautiful girl **of** my class. ➡ 🟢She's the most beautiful girl **in** my class. <br/>
> Grandpa is the oldest person in the family. <br/>
> What's the highest mountain in the United Kingdom? <br/>
> The festival is held in the biggest town on the island. <br/>

We can emphasize the meaning with our personal experience, the word **even**, the word **very**
or the phrase **by far**.

> Lord of the Flies is the best book **I've ever read**. <br/>
> That's the most ridiculous thing **I've ever heard**. <br/>
> Iceland is the most beautiful country **I've ever been to**. <br/>
> That was the best movie **ever**! 💡*To byl ten nejlepší film, co jsem kdy viděl.* <br/>
> This is your best idea **by far**. 💡*Toto je zdaleka tvůj nejlepší nápad.* <br/>
> It was **by far the most** expensive hotel we've ever stayed in. <br/>
> It's **by far the best** pizza place in the city. <br/>
> I've always tried to do my very best. 💡*Vždycky jsem se snažil udělat, co je v mých silách.* <br/>
