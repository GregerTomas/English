## Extreme adjectives

There are three possible options how to strengthen an adjective.

* **gradation of adjectives (comparative + superlative)** (ğŸ’¡*bigger/biggest*)
* **use an adverb** (ğŸ’¡*very big*)
* **use a synonym with a stronger meaning** (ğŸ’¡*enormous*)

We use **extreme adjectives** neither in the comparative or superlative nor with some emphasizing adverbs (**very**, **
extremely**, **fairly**, **slightly**, ...).

> ğŸ”´ His second book was **more excellent** than his first. <br/>
> ğŸ”´ His second book was **very excellent**. <br/>

We can use following adverbs before extreme adjectives.

> absolutely ğŸ’¡*absolutnÄ›* <br/>
> completely ğŸ’¡*zcela* <br/>
> really ğŸ’¡*opravdu* <br/>
> simply ğŸ’¡*jednoduÅ¡e* <br/>
> entirely ğŸ’¡*zcela* <br/>
> perfectly ğŸ’¡*dokonale* <br/>
> totally ğŸ’¡*ÃºplnÄ›* <br/>
> utterly ğŸ’¡*naprosto* <br/>
> quite ğŸ’¡*zcela* <br/>

> Mom was **absolutely furious** when she found out I had been drinking. <br/>
> The story was **completely fascinating**. <br/>
> I was **totally astonished** to hear that they were getting married. <br/>
> She is **simply gorgeous**, don't you think? <br/>
