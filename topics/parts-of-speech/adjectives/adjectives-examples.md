# Adjectives - examples

## Extreme adjectives

There are three possible options how to strengthen an adjective.

* **gradation of adjectives (comparative + superlative)** (💡*bigger/biggest*)
* **use an adverb** (💡*very big*)
* **use a synonym with a stronger meaning** (💡*enormous*)

We use **extreme adjectives** neither in the comparative or superlative nor with some emphasizing adverbs (**very**, **
extremely**, **fairly**, **slightly**, ...).

> 🔴 His second book was **more excellent** than his first. <br/>
> 🔴 His second book was **very excellent**. <br/>

We can use following adverbs before extreme adjectives.

> absolutely 💡*absolutně* <br/>
> completely 💡*zcela* <br/>
> really 💡*opravdu* <br/>
> simply 💡*jednoduše* <br/>
> entirely 💡*zcela* <br/>
> perfectly 💡*dokonale* <br/>
> totally 💡*úplně* <br/>
> utterly 💡*naprosto* <br/>
> quite 💡*zcela* <br/>

> Mom was **absolutely furious** when she found out I had been drinking. <br/>
> The story was **completely fascinating**. <br/>
> I was **totally astonished** to hear that they were getting married. <br/>
> She is **simply gorgeous**, don't you think? <br/>
> The story was **utterly terrifying**. <br/>
> When we finally got home, we were all **completely exhausted**. <br/>
> Our dinner was **absolutely delicious**. <br/>
