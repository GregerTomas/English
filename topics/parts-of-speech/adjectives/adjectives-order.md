## Two basic rules

### Opinions 🆚 facts

Opinion should be placed first.

> He was wearing a **stylish leather** jacket. 💡*stylish (opinion), leather (fact)* <br/>
> It was a story about an **ugly green** frog. <br/>
> She's watching some **stupid Spanish** soap opera. <br/>

### Type and purpose

Type and purpose adjectives are tightly connected with noun. There can't be another adjective between them.

> 🔴 a coffee new cup ➡ 🟢 a new coffee cup <br/>
> 🔴 a coffee porcelain cup ➡ 🟢 a porcelain coffee cup <br/>
> 🔴 a coffee white cup ➡ 🟢 a white coffee cup <br/>

> He has a new sports car. <br/>
> We have a new English teacher. <br/>
> You don't need expensive reading glasses. <br/>
> 'Cava' is Spanish sparkling wine. <br/>

## Punctuation / conjunctions

We use punctuation only if there are multiple opinion adjectives before a noun.

> 🔴 an interesting, new article ➡ 🟢 an interesting new article 💡*opinion + fact* <br/>
> I want to meet a **nice, intelligent** girl. <br/>
> We spent a **pleasant, enjoyable** week in the mountains. <br/>

We can use the conjunction **and** with multiple colors or materials.

> a **black and yellow** sports car <br/>
> a **glass and steel** structure <br/>

If we use adjectives after the verb **be**, they are separated by the comma and the last one by the conjunction **and**.
We do not have to care about the order as well.

> The man was tall, young, handsome and rich. <br/>
