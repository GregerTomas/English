# Gradation

## Strengthening

There are 3 forms:

* **basic form**
* **comparative** 💡*We use it for comparing things.*
* **superlative** 💡*We select one thing from a collection which is best based on a concrete property.*

### Short adjectives

They usually consist of one syllable (e.g. **nice**, **big**, **green**, **slow**, **quick**, **small**). two-syllable
adjectives ending in **-y** (**happy**, **funny**, **healthy**, **pretty**) and some two-syllable (**yellow**, **
hollow**, **clever**, **stupid**).

Suffixes **-er** and **-est** are used for gradation.

| basic form	 | comparative | superlative |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| slow        | 	slower     | 	slowest    | 
| nice        | nicer       | 	nicest     |
| big         | bigger      | biggest     |
| happy       | 	happier    | happiest    |

#### Grammar changes

**adjectives ending with -e** - only one **-e**

> 🔴 niceer ➡ 🟢 nicer <br/>

**adjectives ending with *consonant + vowel + consonant*** - doubled consonant

> big ➡ bigger <br/>
> thin ➡ thinner <br/>
> hot ➡ hotter <br/>

**adjectives ending with -y** - exchange from **-y** to **-i**

> funny ➡ funnier <br/>
> dry ➡ drier <br/>

### Long adjectives

They usually consist of two or more syllables. Adverbs **more** and **most** are used for gradation.

| basic form	 | comparative      | superlative      |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| interesting | more interesting | most interesting |
| beautiful   | more beautiful   | most beautiful   |
| useful      | more useful      | most useful      |

### Irregular gradation

| basic form	               | comparative                       | superlative                            |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| good                      | better                            | lepší	best                             |
| bad                       | worse                             | worst                                  |
| far 💡*vzdálený, DalekJS* | farther / further 💡*vzdálenější* | farthest / furthest 💡*nejvzdálenější* |    
| little 💡*malý*           | lesser 💡*menší, méně závažný*    | least 💡*nejmenší, nejméně závažný*    | 

### Ungradable adjectives

Some adjectives cannot be graded, for example [extreme adjectives](adjectives-examples.md#extreme-adjectives) or
adjectives like **broken**, **boiling**, **perfect**, etc.

### Use

#### Comparative

It is used from comparison of two things, very often used with the preposition **than**.

> Mark is taller than John. <br/>
> Books are better than movies. <br/>
> Japanese is more difficult than Spanish. <br/>
> I heard that dolphins are more intelligent than humans. Is it true? <br/>

We can adjust the meaning with words like **far, much, a lot, way** or  **a little, a bit**.

> Cats are far more intelligent than dogs. <br/>
> That's much better. Well done! <br/>
> The problem was a lot worse than we first thought. <br/>
> Jake's dad is way cooler than you! <br/>
> I feel a little better today. <br/>
> This movie was a bit more interesting than the one we saw last week. <br/>

We use the object form of a pronoun (or even the subject form, but it is not recommended) when we use **than + pronoun**
, and the subject form
when we use **than + pronoun + verb**.

> 🔴 You're taller than **he**. ➡ 🟢 You're taller than **him**. <br/>
> You're taller than he is. 🔃 You're taller than him. <br/>
> You look better than I do. 🔃 You look better than me. <br/>

Rules for determiners apply as usual.

> You'll need a better computer. <br/>
> Both books are good, but this one is better. <br/>
> Choose the better option. <br/>

#### Superlative

It is used from comparison of more than two things in order to select the best one, therefore we use the definitive
article. Never ever we can use a possessive pronoun together with the definite article.

> This is the best thing I've ever eaten! <br/>
> The fastest swimmer will get a prize. <br/>
> He always buys the most expensive shoes. <br/>
> Thanks! You're the best! <br/>
> 🔴 He's **my the best** friend. ➡ 🟢 He's **my best** friend. <br/>
> 🔴 "The Da Vinci Code" is **his the most** popular novel. ➡ 🟢 "The Da Vinci Code" is **his most** popular novel. <br/>

We often use the preposition **of** together with **superlative**. If we select the best thing in a place, group, etc.,
we use a place preposition like **in** or **on**.

> He's the tallest of the three of us. <br/>
> 🔴 She's the most beautiful girl **of** my class. ➡ 🟢She's the most beautiful girl **in** my class. <br/>
> Grandpa is the oldest person in the family. <br/>
> What's the highest mountain in the United Kingdom? <br/>
> The festival is held in the biggest town on the island. <br/>

We can emphasize the meaning with our personal experience, the word **even**, the word **very**
or the phrase **by far**.

> Lord of the Flies is the best book **I've ever read**. <br/>
> That's the most ridiculous thing **I've ever heard**. <br/>
> Iceland is the most beautiful country **I've ever been to**. <br/>
> That was the best movie **ever**! 💡*To byl ten nejlepší film, co jsem kdy viděl.* <br/>
> This is your best idea **by far**. 💡*Toto je zdaleka tvůj nejlepší nápad.* <br/>
> It was **by far the most** expensive hotel we've ever stayed in. <br/>
> It's **by far the best** pizza place in the city. <br/>
> I've always tried to do my very best. 💡*Vždycky jsem se snažil udělat, co je v mých silách.* <br/>

##### Superlative without definite article

###### Combination with possessive pronoun

> 🔴 Who is **your the best** friend? ➡ 🟢 Who is **your best** friend? <br/>
> 🔴 John is **my the oldest** son. ➡ 🟢 John is **my oldest** son. <br/>
> 🔴 Have you read **her the most** recent book? ➡ 🟢 Have you read **her most** recent book? <br/>
> It was Peter's most embarassing experience. <br/>
> Neblina Peak is Brazil's highest mountain. <br/>

###### Variant comparison

We do not compare things, but variants of the same thing.

> Tea is best when served in china cups. <br/>
> Shadows are longest in the early morning and late afternoon. <br/>
> People are easiest to control when they are afraid. <br/>

###### Wh- and verb be

It is not necessary to use the definite article in interrogative or subject clauses, where a pronoun **what**
, **who**, **which*, etc. and the verb **be** is used. In the ✏ formal English, the definite article can be used.
> You don't know what's **(the) best** for you. <br/>
> Who's going to win? That depends on who's **(the) strongest**. <br/>

###### Adverb gradation

Again, in the ✏ formal English, the definite article can be used.

> They all ran fast but John ran **(the) fastest**. <br/>
> In my family, I am the one who gets up **(the) earliest**. <br/>

###### ✏ Absolute superlative

This grammar is not frequent.

Absolute superlative means 💡*velmi*, not 💡*nejvíce*. We do not compare things between each other, but we just highlight
the thing. The absolute superlative basically replaces word like **very**, **absolutely** or **extremely**. It does not
express one particular thing, so we use with it an indefinite or zero article.

> It is the most interesting story you have ever told me. 💡*It is relative, I do not say that your stories are
interesting at all.* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> It was **a most interesting** story. 💡*very* <br/>

> It's the most beautiful song I've heard. 💡*Je to nejhezčí píseň, co jsem kdy slyšel.* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> It's a most beautiful song. 💡*Je to překrásná píseň. Neporovnávám, ale vyzdvihuji, vychvaluji.* <br/>

> It was the most fascinating film I saw at the festival. 💡*Byl to nejúchvatnější film, který jsem na tom festivalu
viděl.* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> It was a most fascinating film. 💡*Byl to neskutečně struhující film.* <br/>

> It's **an extremely beautiful** song. 🔃 It's **a most beautiful** song. <br/>
> It was **a very interesting** book. 🔃 It was **a most interesting** book. <br/>
> That's **very interesting**. 🔃 Oh, that's **most interesting**. <br/>
> The soup was **absolutely delicious**. 🔃 The soup was **most delicious**. <br/>

In this case, we use **most** even for short adjectives.

> You've been most kind. 💡*Byl jste velice laskav.* <br/>

More examples follow.

> That would be **most unfortunate**. <br/>
> You are **most welcome** here. <br/>
> He was a **most peculiar** man. <br/>
> His father was **a most remarkable** person. <br/>
> Ruth is **a most sweet** girl. <br/>
> I had **a most strange** dream. <br/>
> It's **a most beautiful** day! <br/>
> We had **a most wonderful** view. <br/>

## Weakening

We use only one type of gradation, using the adverbs **less** and **least**.

| basic form               | comparative                        | superlative                            |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| interesting 💡*zajímavý* | less interesting 💡*méně zajímavý* | least interesting 💡*nejméně zajímavý* |
| beautiful                | less beautiful                     | least beautiful                        | 
| useful                   | less useful                        | least useful                           |
| funny                    | less funny                         | least funny                            |

> For me, History is less interesting than English Literature. <br/>
> He was the least popular kid in my class and look at him now! <br/>
> She isn't any less beautiful than she was then. <br/>
> His mother openly called him the least intelligent of her kids. <br/>

We use antonymous for some adjectives which we can grade the classic way.

| basic form | comparative               | superlative                 |
|------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| big        | 🔴 less big ➡ 🟢 smaller  | 🔴 least big ➡ 🟢 smallest  |
| slow       | 🔴 less slow ➡ 🟢 faster  | 🔴 least slow ➡ 🟢 fastest  |
| short      | 🔴 less short ➡ 🟢 longer | 🔴 least short ➡ 🟢 longest |

> A snail moves faster than you do! <br/>
> Texas is smaller than Alaska. <br/>
> A Lamborghini is cheaper than a Pagani. <br/>
> Emma Watson is less pretty than Emma Stone. <br/>

### Not as ... as ...

Sometimes the question is whether to use a gradation with **less / least** or the classic gradation of an adjective
with opposite meaning. We can use the phrase **not as ... as ...** instead of the awkward phrase **less + adjective +
than**.

> less tall than 💡*ne tak vysoký jako* ➡ not as tall as 💡*ne tak vysoký jako* <br/>
> less pretty than 💡*méně krásná než* ➡ not as pretty as 💡*ne tak krásná jako* <br/>

> Mike is not as tall as his dad. <br/>
> Anna is not as pretty as Theresa. <br/>
> The movie wasn't as funny as I remembered it. <br/>

This phrase should be used with the verb **be** and with no noun after the adjective.

> Někdo nemá tak dlouhé vlasy jako někdo jiný. ➡ Vlasy nejsou ... <br/>
> Někdo nesl ne tak těžký kufr jako někdo jiný. ➡ Kufr nebyl ... <br/>

> Jane's hair is not as long as her mother's. <br/>
> The suitcase he carried was not as heavy as the one I carried. <br/>

## The ..., the ... phrases

### The + comparative, the + comparative

💡 čím, tím

> **The warmer** it is, **the happier** I am. 💡*Čím je tepleji, tím jsem šťastnější.* <br/>

We cannot use short forms of **subject + verb**.

> 🔴 The warmer it's, the happier I'm. ➡ 🟢 The warmer it is, the happier I am. <br/>

We use present tenses for common truths.

> **The warmer** it is, **the better** I feel. <br/>
> **The colder** it is, **the worse** I feel. <br/>
> **The older** you are, **the wiser** you become. <br/>
> **The warmer** the weather is, **the better** I like it. <br/>

If we want to express the future, we use a time or conditional subordinate clause, so the main clause expresses the
future, the subordinate clause is in the present tense.

> The sooner we **start**, the sooner we **will finish**. <br/>
> The faster he **runs**, the sooner he **will reach** the house. <br/>

We can also express the past.

> The longer I waited, the angrier I got. <br/>
> The darker the clouds were, the faster we ran towards the house. <br/>

### The more ..., the more ...

💡 čím víc ..., tím víc ...

> **The more** people you invite, **the more** food you'll have to prepare. <br/>
> **The more** he drank, **the more** beautiful she became. <br/>
> **The more** she talked, **the more** confused I was. <br/>
> **The more** I thought about it, **the more** frightened I got. <br/>

We can combine it with [The + comparative, the + comparative](#the--comparative-the--comparative).

> **The harder** you study, **the more** you learn. <br/>
> **The harder** you study, **the more** you will learn. <br/>
> **The harder** I studied, **the more** I learned. <br/>

We can use also say the opposite with **less** or **fewer** (💡*čím míň ..., tím míň ...*).

> The less I know about her problems, the happier I will be. <br/>
> The fewer people come, the more food there will be for us. <br/>

Be aware of the word order.

> 🔴 The more you invite people, the more you'll have to prepare food. ➡ 🟢 The more people you invite, the more food
> you'll have to prepare. <br/>
> 🔴 The more she talked, the more I was confused. ➡ 🟢 The more she talked, the more confused I was. <br/>

> 🔴 The more did she talk, the more confused was I. <br/>
> 🔴 The more talked she, the more confused was I. <br/>
> ➡ 🟢 The more she talked, the more confused I was. <br/>

### Omission of subject, object or verb

We can omit the verb **be**.

> **The warmer** the weather is, **the better** I like it. ➡ **The warmer** the weather, **the better** I like it. <br/>
> **The older** the boy is, **the bigger** the problems are. ➡ **The older** the boy, **the bigger** the problems. <br/>

We can omit the subject or object, if they are clear from the context.

> **The sooner** you come, **the better**.
> ➡ **The sooner** you bring it, **the better**.
> ➡ **The sooner**, the better. <br/>
> **The spicier** the food is, **the better**. ➡ **The spicier**, **the better**. <br/>
> **The less** he knows about it, **the better**. ➡ **The less**, **the better**. <br/>
> **The more** I know about the problem, **the better**. ➡ **The more**, **the better**. <br/>
> **The more** people come, **the merrier** the party will be. ➡ **The more**, **the merrier**. <br/>
