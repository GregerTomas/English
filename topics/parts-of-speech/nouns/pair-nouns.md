# Pair nouns

> goods 💡*zboží* <br/>
> barracks 💡*kasárny* <br/>
> trousers <br/>
> scissors <br/>
> pyjamas <br/>
> glasses <br/>

If we want to count them, we must use the phrase **a pair of** or **a set of**.

> a pair of trousers 💡*jedny kalhoty* <br/>
> two pairs of glasses 💡*dvoje brýle* <br/>
> two sets of wings 💡*dva páry křídel* <br/>
> He bought her a new pair of earrings for her birthday.  <br/>
> I buy a new pair of boots every winter. <br/>
> How much does a new pair of glasses cost? <br/>
> You don't need four pairs of boots! <br/>
> He owns like 20 pairs of sunglasses! <br/>
> Many insects have two pairs / sets of wings. <br/>

The verb form is determined by the **pair** noun.

> This pair of socks is mine. <br/>
> A pair of scissors was found near his body. <br>
> There were two pairs of glasses on the floor. <br>

### Things consisted by the two identical parts

These nouns exist only in plural. In Czech we call them 💡*pomnožná podstatná jména*.

> 🔴 one trouser ➡ 🟢 one pair of trousers <br/>
> glasses <br/>
> pants <br/>

We can meet these words in singular, but only if we use them as an adjective. We can use a noun before another noun as
an adjective, in this case we use a singular noun.

> scissor manufacturer 💡*výrobce nůžek* <br/>
> pyjama bottoms 💡*kalhoty od pyžama* <br/>

#### 'Trouser' type clothes

> panties
> pyjamas
> shorts 💡*kraťasy*
> trousers

But for example **bikini** or **swimsuit** belong between countable nouns.

> Lauren packed three swimsuits. (🔴 pairs of swimsuit) <br/>
> She's going on vacation next week. She even bought herself a new bikini. (🔴 a pair of bikini) <br/>
