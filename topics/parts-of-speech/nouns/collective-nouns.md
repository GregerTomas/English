# Collective nouns

💡hromadná podstatná jména

We use them for nous which represent a group of people / things / animals of the same species. They are often used with
the preposition **of**.

> team <br/>
> family <br/>
> staff 💡*personál, zaměstnanci* <br/>
> class <br/>
> bank <br/>
> ministry <br/>
> government <br/>
> committee 💡*komise, výbor* <br/>
> firm <br/>
> school <br/>
> club <br/>
> choir <br/>
> group <br/>
> crowd <br/>
> crew 💡*posádka* <br/>
> band <br/>
> board 💡*vedení, rada (např. školy)* <br/>

A lot of nouns representing a group of animals belong there.
> herd 💡*stádo*
> flock 💡*hejno ptáků*
> pack 💡*hejno ryb*
> shoal 💡*rok hmyzu*

### With singular verb

Generally, we consider collective nouns as a one piece and use a singular verb after these nouns.

> The team has a good coach. They hope to win. <br/>
> The government is elected every four years. <br/>
> It's his last night here. His family moves to Philadelphia next week. <br/>

### With plural verb

In rare cases, we can consider a collective noun as a representative of individual members. In that case, we use a
plural verb.

> All my family hope I'll go to university next year. But I'm not so sure I want it myself! <br/>
> All the government are over 60. <br/>
> The team are a bit apprehensive of the Thursday's finals. <br/>

It is often better to replace it with words like **member**, **player**, **employee**, etc.

> The team have short hair. ➡ The team members have short hair. <br/>
> The players were all tall and handsome. <br/>
