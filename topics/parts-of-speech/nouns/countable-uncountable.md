We use singular verb form after uncountable nouns.

> news is

We never use a plural, number or an indefinite article with these nouns.

> 🔴informations, advices <br/>
> 🔴two informations, three advices, four news <br/>
> 🔴an information, an advice, a news <br/>

### A piece of / a bit of / etc.

We use these phrases when we need to count an uncountable noun.
