# Genitive

## Be at somebody's / go to somebody's

We use a preposition **at** when we want to say that we are in somebody's flat / house, or we are going to somebody's
flat / house.

> at my place 💡*u mě (doma)* <br/>
> at her grandma's place 💡*u její babičky (doma)* <br/>
> I've never been at his place. He owns a small flat in the city centre, doesn't he? <br/>
> I'm sure you would behave differently if you were at your mother's place. <br/>
> I'm at Susan's place right now. I will call back later, ok? <br/>

> to his place 💡k němu (domů)* <br/>
> to our parents' place 💡*k rodičům (domů)* <br/>
> Why don't we go to your place and celebrate? <br/>
> What are your plans for tonight? – I'm going to Simon's place. <br/>
> Do you want to go to your place or mine? <br/>

We can replace the word **place** with the word **house**. It does not matter whether we talk about house, flat or
something else.

> I will be at Paul's house all day tomorrow. <br/>
> Hey guys, do you want to come to my house on Friday? <br/>

We can omit the word **place** completely, if we talk about a concrete person, but the genitive remains.

> 🔴 I was at Susan yesterday. ➡ 🟢 I was at Susan's yesterday. <br/>
> 🔴 I'm going to my mother tomorrow. ➡ 🟢 I'm going to my mother's tomorrow. <br/>
> Steve called his mother to tell her he would be at Paul's all weekend. <br/>
> I think he's at his grandma's. Why don't you give him a call? <br/>
> Can you drop me off at Victor's? I need to talk to him? <br/>
> We're going to Jessica's. Do you want to come? <br/>

In British English you can experience the omitted **place** word even for possessive pronouns.

> 🔴 Were you at her again? ➡ 🟢 Were you at hers again? <br/>
> 🔴 Let's go to her. ➡ 🟢 Let's go to hers. <br/>

This grammar is not only used to speak about being at somebody's home, for example it is also used to say that we are at
doctor's.

> I'll be at the doctor's office this afternoon. ➡ She was at the doctor's yesterday. <br/>
> He's gone to the doctor's office. Can you call back tomorrow? ➡ Jack went to the doctor's a while ago. <br/>
