# Genitive

## Be at somebody's / go to somebody's

We use a preposition **at** when we want to say that we are in somebody's flat / house, or we are going to somebody's
flat / house.

> at my place 💡*u mě (doma)* <br/>
> at her grandma's place 💡*u její babičky (doma)* <br/>
> I've never been at his place. He owns a small flat in the city centre, doesn't he? <br/>
> I'm sure you would behave differently if you were at your mother's place. <br/>
> I'm at Susan's place right now. I will call back later, ok? <br/>

> to his place 💡k němu (domů)* <br/>
> to our parents' place 💡*k rodičům (domů)* <br/>
> Why don't we go to your place and celebrate? <br/>
> What are your plans for tonight? – I'm going to Simon's place. <br/>
> Do you want to go to your place or mine? <br/>

We can replace the word **place** with the word **house**. It does not matter whether we talk about house, flat or
something else.

> I will be at Paul's house all day tomorrow. <br/>
> Hey guys, do you want to come to my house on Friday? <br/>

We can omit the word **place** completely, if we talk about a concrete person, but the genitive remains.

> 🔴 I was at Susan yesterday. ➡ 🟢 I was at Susan's yesterday. <br/>
> 🔴 I'm going to my mother tomorrow. ➡ 🟢 I'm going to my mother's tomorrow. <br/>
> Steve called his mother to tell her he would be at Paul's all weekend. <br/>
> I think he's at his grandma's. Why don't you give him a call? <br/>
> Can you drop me off at Victor's? I need to talk to him? <br/>
> We're going to Jessica's. Do you want to come? <br/>

In British English you can experience the omitted **place** word even for possessive pronouns.

> 🔴 Were you at her again? ➡ 🟢 Were you at hers again? <br/>
> 🔴 Let's go to her. ➡ 🟢 Let's go to hers. <br/>

This grammar is not only used to speak about being at somebody's home, for example it is also used to say that we are at
doctor's.

> I'll be at the doctor's office this afternoon. ➡ She was at the doctor's yesterday. <br/>
> He's gone to the doctor's office. Can you call back tomorrow? ➡ Jack went to the doctor's a while ago. <br/>

## Double genitive

As an example, we can mention the phrase **a friend of mine**. There are two genitives in this phrase.

1. preposition **of**
2. possessive pronouns

### single vs double genitive

| genitive   | phrase           | meaning              | general meaning                   |
|------------|------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **single** | my friend        | a very closed friend | a special one from the collection |
| **double** | a friend of mine | one of my friends    | one of the collection             |

> a student of mine *(a teacher has many students)* 💡*můj student (jeden z mých studentů)* <br/>
> my car, my house *(a person has usually one car / house)* 💡*moje auto / můj dům* <br/>
> a car of mine *(you can have more than one car)* 💡*moje auto (jedno z mých aut)*

We can not use a possessive pronoun with some words (articles, indicative pronouns, ...). We use freestanding possessive
pronouns, the possessive case or a noun (*in case of more than one word behind the preposition **of***) in this kind of
phrases (**mine**, **yours**, **ours**, **Jack's**, **a friend of Mr. Jack Peterson**, ...).

> 🔴 This my habit. ➡ 🟢 This habit of mine. 💡*tenhle můj zlozvyk* <br/>
> 🔴 Some Jack's friends. ➡ 🟢 Some friends of Jack's. <br/>
> Is she a friend of yours? <br/>
> They are students of ours. <br/>
> They're friends of my sister's. <br/>
> Are they students of Mr White's? <br/>
> A friend of Mr. Jack Peterson. <br/>

There can be a difference in meaning when you use a noun instead of the possessive case, compare following.

> a bone of the dog 💡*kost psa (mohla by to být psí kost, tedy kost z psí kostry)* <br>
> a bone of the dog's 💡*kost psa (ten pes si ji vzal, má ji, a hlídá si ji, ohryzává ji atd.)* <br>

> the students of Aristotle 💡*studenti studují jeho dílo (např. i dnešní studenti)* <br>
> the students of Aristotle's 💡*studenti, kteří s ním studovali, byli jeho žáky* <br>
