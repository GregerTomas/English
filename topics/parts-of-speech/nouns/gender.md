There are universal nouns which can refer to both men and women.

> friend, student, classmate, doctor, singer, teacher, ... <br/>

We can distinguish the gender by a pronoun or an adjective.

> I have a new teacher. **She** is very kind. <br/>
> I have a new friend. **His** name is Jack. <br/>
> Some students prefer male teachers over female teachers. <br/>

If we do not distinguish the gender, we can use **they** or **their**.

> The person had something in their hand. <br/>
> Every parent wants to watch their child succeed, **don't** they? <br/>
> Each customer must feel they received a quality product at a fair price. <br/>
> Somebody took it, didn't they? <br/>

## Animals

In general, animals belong between inanimate nouns, so we use for them the pronoun **it** and the relative pronoun **
which**.

> Look at the cat! It's beautiful. <br/>
> The horse broke its leg. <br/>
> The lion which we saw in the zoo was very big. <br/>

We can consider a pets as animate nouns, so we use for them the pronoun **he / she** and the relative pronoun **who**.

> The horse which won the race was quite young. ðŸ†š My horse, who is five years old, can run very fast. <br/>
