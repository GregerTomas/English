> This is your book. <br/>
> This book is yours. <br/>
> This is yours. <br/>
> This is yours for two days. <br/>
> This is your book and this is my book. <br/>
> This is your book and this one is mine. <br/>
> This is yours and this is mine. <br/>

## Subject or object pronoun

In formal English you can use a subject pronoun after a linking verb.

> ✏ It was I. <br/>
> 🗣 It was me. <br/>
> Yes, this is he / she. <br/>

## Alone pronoun

The subject pronoun form is preferred.

> Come here. Who? Me? <br/>
> Who is it? Me! <br/>
> She's pretty! Her? No way. <br/>
> Me, I don't know. <br/>

## Reflexive and emphatic pronouns

| pronoun | reflexive pronoun |
|---------|-------------------|
| I       | myself            |
| your    | yourself          |
| he      | himself           |
| she     | herself           |
| it      | itself            |
| we      | ourselves         |
| you     | yourselves        |
| they    | themselves        |

We often use them as a object of a verb or after a preposition. It expresses that we mean the same person as the
subject.

> He saw him in the mirror. 💡*Viděl někoho jiného v zrcadle.* ➡ He saw himself in the mirror. 💡*Viděl sebe v
zrcadle.* <br/>
> She talked about her all the time. ➡ She talked about herself all the time. <br/>

Some verbs are used with reflexive pronouns.

> I'm enjoying myself. <br/>
> Behave yourself! 💡*Chovej se slušně.* <br/>
> Help yourself. 💡*Nabídni si.* <br/>

### By myself / on my own

💡někdo něco udělal bez druhých, udělal to samostatně

> Everybody had already seen the film, so I watched it by myself. <br/>
> Nobody wanted to help us so we did it all by ourselves. <br/>
> I want to live by myself ➡ I want to live on my own. <br/>

### Each other / one another 🆚 reflexive pronoun

> They saw each other. 💡*viděli se navzájem, on viděl ji, ona viděla jeho* <br/>
> They saw themselves. 💡*viděli sami sebe, on viděl sebe, ona viděla sebe* <br/>
> They love each other. 💡*on miluje ji, ona miluje jeho* <br/>
> They only love themselves. 💡*mají rádi jen každý sám sebe* <br/>

### Emphasize

We can use a reflexive pronoun to emphasize the subject or an object.

> The King himself didn't know what to do. <br/>
> Somebody broke into my car last night. A few things were stolen but the car itself is ok. <br/>
> I do most of the jobs around the house myself. In this way I save a lot of money. <br/>

### Myself 🆚 by myself

> I did it by myself. 💡*I did it alone.* <br/>
> I did it myself. 💡*It was me who did it.* <br/>

> Jack's driver was drunk so Jack had to drive himself. 🆚 Nobody wanted to go with Jack so he had to drive by
> himself. <br/>
> Jack had a lot to learn before he could drive by himself. <br/>
> I bought him a drink but he didn't want it, so I had to drink it myself. 🆚 Nobody came to the party so I drank the
> whole bottle by myself. <br/>

## Each other

See [here](../determiners/basic-determiners.md)

## Demonstratives

**this** 💡tento
**these** 💡tyto
**that** 💡tamten
**those** 💡tamty

We use **this** and **these** for things the speaker has nearby (they are *here*). In opposite, we use **that** and **
those** for things
that are distant from the speaker, are with person being spoken to or are with a third person (they are *there*).

> This is my bag. <br/>
> These are my shoes. <br/>
> That is your bag. <br/>
> Those are your shoes. <br/>

Demonstratives should be used only if necessary.

> 🔴 What's this? This is my bag. What's this? ➡ 🟢 What's this? It's my bag. <br/>
> 🔴 Is that your car? – That's mine. ➡ 🟢 Is that your car? Yes, it's mine. <br/>
> What are these? They are my sleeping pills. <br/>
> The table is black. 🆚 This table is black. 💡If there is only one table in the room, we should use the definite
> article. <br/>
