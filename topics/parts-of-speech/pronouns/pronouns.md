## Subject or object pronoun

In formal English you can use a subject pronoun after a linking verb.

> ✏ It was I. <br/>
> 🗣 It was me. <br/>
> Yes, this is he / she. <br/>

## Alone pronoun

The subject pronoun form is preferred.

> Come here. Who? Me? <br/>
> Who is it? Me! <br/>
> She's pretty! Her? No way. <br/>
> Me, I don't know. <br/>

## Reflexive and emphatic pronouns

| pronoun | reflexive pronoun |
|---------|-------------------|
| I       | myself            |
| your    | yourself          |
| he      | himself           |
| she     | herself           |
| it      | itself            |
| we      | ourselves         |
| you     | yourselves        |
| they    | themselves        |

We often use them as a object of a verb or after a preposition. It expresses that we mean the same person as the
subject.

> He saw him in the mirror. 💡*Viděl někoho jiného v zrcadle.* ➡ He saw himself in the mirror. 💡*Viděl sebe v
zrcadle.* <br/>
> She talked about her all the time. ➡ She talked about herself all the time. <br/>

Some verbs are used with reflexive pronouns.

> I'm enjoying myself. <br/>
> Behave yourself! 💡*Chovej se slušně.* <br/>
> Help yourself. 💡*Nabídni si.* <br/>

### By myself / on my own

> Everybody had already seen the film, so I watched it by myself. <br/>
> Nobody wanted to help us so we did it all by ourselves. <br/>
> I want to live by myself ➡ I want to live on my own. <br/>

### Each other / one another 🆚 reflexive pronoun

> They saw each other. 💡*viděli se navzájem, on viděl ji, ona viděla jeho* <br/>
> They saw themselves. 💡*viděli sami sebe, on viděl sebe, ona viděla sebe* <br/>
> They love each other. 💡*on miluje ji, ona miluje jeho* <br/>
> They only love themselves. 💡*mají rádi jen každý sám sebe* <br/>

### Emphasize

We can use a reflexive pronoun to emphasize the subject or an object.

> The King himself didn't know what to do. <br/>
> Somebody broke into my car last night. A few things were stolen but the car itself is ok. <br/>
> I do most of the jobs around the house myself. In this way I save a lot of money. <br/>
