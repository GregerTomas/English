> This is your book. <br/>
> This book is yours. <br/>
> This is yours. <br/>
> This is yours for two days. <br/>
> This is your book and this is my book. <br/>
> This is your book and this one is mine. <br/>
> This is yours and this is mine. <br/>

## Subject or object pronoun

In formal English you can use a subject pronoun after a linking verb.

> ✏ It was I. <br/>
> 🗣 It was me. <br/>
> Yes, this is he / she. <br/>

## Alone pronoun

The subject pronoun form is preferred.

> Come here. Who? Me? <br/>
> Who is it? Me! <br/>
> She's pretty! Her? No way. <br/>
> Me, I don't know. <br/>

## Reflexive and emphatic pronouns

| pronoun | reflexive pronoun |
|---------|-------------------|
| I       | myself            |
| your    | yourself          |
| he      | himself           |
| she     | herself           |
| it      | itself            |
| we      | ourselves         |
| you     | yourselves        |
| they    | themselves        |

We often use them as a object of a verb or after a preposition. It expresses that we mean the same person as the
subject.

> He saw him in the mirror. 💡*Viděl někoho jiného v zrcadle.* ➡ He saw himself in the mirror. 💡*Viděl sebe v
zrcadle.* <br/>
> She talked about her all the time. ➡ She talked about herself all the time. <br/>

Some verbs are used with reflexive pronouns.

> I'm enjoying myself. <br/>
> Behave yourself! 💡*Chovej se slušně.* <br/>
> Help yourself. 💡*Nabídni si.* <br/>

### By myself / on my own

💡někdo něco udělal bez druhých, udělal to samostatně

> Everybody had already seen the film, so I watched it by myself. <br/>
> Nobody wanted to help us so we did it all by ourselves. <br/>
> I want to live by myself ➡ I want to live on my own. <br/>

### Each other / one another 🆚 reflexive pronoun

> They saw each other. 💡*viděli se navzájem, on viděl ji, ona viděla jeho* <br/>
> They saw themselves. 💡*viděli sami sebe, on viděl sebe, ona viděla sebe* <br/>
> They love each other. 💡*on miluje ji, ona miluje jeho* <br/>
> They only love themselves. 💡*mají rádi jen každý sám sebe* <br/>

### Emphasize

We can use a reflexive pronoun to emphasize the subject or an object.

> The King himself didn't know what to do. <br/>
> Somebody broke into my car last night. A few things were stolen but the car itself is ok. <br/>
> I do most of the jobs around the house myself. In this way I save a lot of money. <br/>

### Myself 🆚 by myself

> I did it by myself. 💡*I did it alone.* <br/>
> I did it myself. 💡*It was me who did it.* <br/>

> Jack's driver was drunk so Jack had to drive himself. 🆚 Nobody wanted to go with Jack so he had to drive by
> himself. <br/>
> Jack had a lot to learn before he could drive by himself. <br/>
> I bought him a drink but he didn't want it, so I had to drink it myself. 🆚 Nobody came to the party so I drank the
> whole bottle by myself. <br/>

## Each other

See [here](../determiners/basic-determiners.md)

## Demonstratives

**this** 💡tento
**these** 💡tyto
**that** 💡tamten
**those** 💡tamty

We use **this** and **these** for things the speaker has nearby (they are *here*). In opposite, we use **that** and **
those** for things
that are distant from the speaker, are with person being spoken to or are with a third person (they are *there*).

> This is my bag. <br/>
> These are my shoes. <br/>
> That is your bag. <br/>
> Those are your shoes. <br/>

Demonstratives should be used only if necessary.

> 🔴 What's this? This is my bag. What's this? ➡ 🟢 What's this? It's my bag. <br/>
> 🔴 Is that your car? – That's mine. ➡ 🟢 Is that your car? Yes, it's mine. <br/>
> What are these? They are my sleeping pills. <br/>
> The table is black. 🆚 This table is black. 💡If there is only one table in the room, we should use the definite
> article. <br/>

## One

We can use pronouns like **someone**, **no one**, **anyone**, etc.

> Someone stole my bag! <br/>
> I haven't seen anyone. <br/>
> No one helped me. <br/>

It can represent an indefinite person as well (✏ rather formal, 🗣 in informal English we can use **you**).

> One never knows. ➡ You never know. <br/>
> It doesn't matter what one believes. <br/>
> Lions are not as dangerous as one might think. ➡ Lions are not as dangerous as you might think. <br/>

It can represent a countable noun, there is even a plural. We can omit it in questions. We can not use it after
possessive pronouns, after numerals and some other words (**many**, **few**, **some**, **both**, **all**, etc.).

> I have two shirts. A blue shirt and a white one. This is the blue one. <br/>
> Which shoes? ➡ Which ones? <br/>
> The red shoes. ➡ The red ones. <br/>
> The shoes that you gave me. ➡ The ones that you gave me. <br/>
> Which (one) do you like better? <br/>
> This (one)? <br/>
> I like these. <br/>
> 🔴 Was the balloon filled with cold air or hot air? – Cold one. 💡*uncountable* <br/>
> 🔴 Your car is broken? You can borrow my one. ➡ 🟢 Your car is broken? You can borrow mine. <br/>
> 🔴 Which one do you like better? Both ones. ➡ 🟢 Which one do you like better? I like both. / I like them both. <br/>
> 🔴 How many dogs do you have? Two ones. ➡ 🟢 How many dogs do you have? I've got two. <br/>

## Compound indefinite pronouns

### Anything

> Does she have anything in her wallet? 💡*něco* <br/>
> I didn't ask him anything. 💡*nic* <br/>
> I need something to eat. Anything! 💡*cokoli* <br/>

### Somebody / someone

> Somebody wants to speak to you. <br/>
> I need someone to help me. <br/>

### Nobody / no one

> No one is going to help you. <br/>

### Anybody / anyone

> Did you know anybody at the party last night? 💡*někoho* <br/>
> She didn't see anybody. 💡*nikoho* <br/>
> Anybody can learn English. 💡*kdokoli* <br/>

### Everybody / everyone

We use a singular verb after them.

> 🔴 Everyone are happy. ➡ 🟢 Everyone is happy. <br/>
> Everybody was smiling. <br/>
> Pay attention, everyone. <br/>

## So

We can replace something which someone recently told (in 🗣informal English we can sometimes use **it**).

> If you haven't registered yet, please do so as soon as possible. <br/>
> She told her dog to sit and it did so immediately. <br/>
> "See? I told you so!" he said triumphantly. <br/>
> If he doesn't want to go to college, why doesn't he say so. <br/>
> I think he's a bit slow. But don't tell him I said so. <br/>
> She works for the government, or so she claims. <br/>
> Did you enjoy the book? If so, what did you like about it? 💡*if it is so* <br/>
> Do you still love me? – Very much so. <br/>

### Think so, believe so, hope so

> I think so. 💡*myslím si, že ano* <br/>
> It seems so. 💡*zdá se, že ano* <br/>
> if so... 💡*jestliže ano* <br/>

We confirm something which was told.

> He said it. 💡*řekl to (slovo, informaci, větu)* 🆚 He said so. 💡*řekl, že to tak je, řekl, že ...* <br/>
> Is she coming to the party? I think so. ➡ I think it's true, I think she is coming to the party. <br/>
> Is Charlie in his office? I believe so. <br/>
> Did you pass the test? Um, I guess so. <br/>
> Don't worry, she will be fine. I really hope so. <br/>
> Does he still work there? Well, I suppose so. <br/>
> I suppose it's going to rain? It certainly seems so. <br/>
> 🔴 Is she coming to the party? I think that yes / I think it. ➡ 🟢 Is she coming to the party? I think so. <br/>
