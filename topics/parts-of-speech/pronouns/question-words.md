# Question words

There two types of question in English.

* **yes / no questions** - start with a verb

> Are you a student? Yes, I am. <br/>
> Do you live in a flat? No, I don't. <br/>

* **wh- questions** - Start with a question word. We expect more detailed answer.

> What is it? It's a book. <br/>
> Where do you live? I live in London. <br/>

The following is a list of question word. See also [this pdf file](question-words.pdf).

## Where

💡kde (ptáme se na místo), kam, kudy

> Where do you live? 💡*Kde bydlíš?* <br/>

> Which pen did he choose? 💡*Které pero si vybral?* <br/>

### Which 🆚 what

When selecting from an indefinite (large) number, use **what**. When selecting from a definite (small) number, use **
which**.

> What ice cream do you like? 💡*Jakou máš rád zmrzlinu? (Ptáme se obecně, jakou má rád zmrzlinu. Ze všech možných
druhů.) <br/>
> Which ice cream do you want? 💡*Kterou chceš zmrzlinu? (Jsme třeba v obchodě, kde mají deset druhů zmrzliny, a ptáme
> se, kterou z těchto deseti někdo chce.) <br/>

> What sport do you like? <br/>
> What colour is your bike? <br/>
> What's your email address? <br/>
> What sandwich filling do you like? <br/>

> Which leg did she break? <br/>
> Which sandwich would you like? Tuna or ham? <br/>
> Which channel is the film on? BBC1 or BBC2? <br/>

## Why

💡proč (ptáme se na důvod)

> Why are you here? 💡*Proč jsi tady?* <br/>
> Why did she call him? 💡*Proč mu volala?* <br/>

## Whose

💡čí (ptáme se na vlastnictví)

> Whose is the sweater? 💡*Čí je ten svetr?* <br/>
> Whose dictionary is it? 💡*Čí je to slovník?* <br/>

## How

💡jak (ptáme se na způsob)

We can use the verb directly after **whose**, but it is not so often.

> How are you? 💡*Jak se máš?* <br/>
> How do you get to work? 💡*Jak jezdíš do práce?* <br/>

## Whom

💡object pronoun *(me, you, him, her. it, us, you, them)*

It can be replaced with **who** (it is preferable) if there is no preposition before (if so, the preposition must be
moved at the end of
the sentence).

> Whom did you see? ➡ Who did you see? <br/>
> The man whom we met was handsome. ➡ The man who we met was handsome. <br/>
> To whom did she talk? ➡ Who did she talk to? <br/>
> The Browns, with whom we spent our vacation, are very nice people. ➡ The Browns, who we spent our vacation with, are
> very nice people. <br/>
> 🔴 To who did she talk? ➡ 🟢 Who did she talk to? <br/>

We use it especially in short questions with a preposition.

> She was in the cinema last night. With whom? <br/>
> For whom are you waiting here? <br/>
> Against whom are you playing that match? <br/>
