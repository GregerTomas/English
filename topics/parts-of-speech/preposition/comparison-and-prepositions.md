# Comparison and prepositions

## The same (as / that)

* the same **as** + a noun / a pronoun
* the same **that** + a subordinate clauses

> His answer was the same as mine. <br/>
> Game developers think that buying used computer games is the same as piracy. <br/>
> What are you doing tonight? – The same as last night. Study. <br/>
> The second verse is the same as the first. <br/>
> He gave me the same answer that he gave the police. <br/>
> The food is the same that you can get at a fast food chain. <br/>

But we use the preposition **to** with identical (= exactly the same).

> They look identical. <br/>
> They are identical twins. <br/>
> Your sweater is identical to mine. <br/>

## Similar (to)

💡podobný (komu / čemu)

> His car is similar to mine. <br/>
> MySpace is a social network similar to Facebook. <br/>

## Look / be (like)

If we need to express similarity, we will need the preposition **like**.

> She looks like Lara Croft. <br/>
> He's like his father, tall, smart and handsome. <br/>
> I want to be less like me and more like you. <br/>

## Different (from)

> Life in the middle ages was different from life today. <br/>
> The Vampire Diaries is quite different from the Twilight Saga. <br/>

We can use **to** (British English) or **than** (American English) as well.

## Differ (from)

> Our opinions differ. <br/>
> My opinions differ from his. <br/>
