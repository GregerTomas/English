# Place prepositions

## By 🆚 at

meaning 💡*u*

We use **by** when we talk just about a placement. In opposite, **at** express that we are in connection with the thing.

> He's sitting by the table. 💡*Sedí u/vedle stolu.* <br/>
> He's sitting at the table. 💡*Sedí u stolu a má na něm rozložené věci, pracuje na něm, jí, ...* <br/>
> <br/>
> She was by the door. 💡*Byla u/vedle dveří - jen tam stála.* <br/>
> She was at the door. 💡*Byla u dveří - chtěla jít dál.* <br/>

> Dinner at my place tonight? – Yeah, great. See you then. <br/>
> You can stay at our place for a few nights if you want. <br/>

We can use **house** instead of **place** or omit it completely. But we muse keep a possessive case.

whole.

### Transport stop, stations, airports

> at the bus stop <br/>
> at the railway station <br/>

### Place on the map

### Place + purpose

> No, he isn't at home. 💡*We do not think only the building.* <br/>

## Where (💡kam) prepositions

### To

💡do, k, na

> to Italy <br/>
> to school <br/>
> to me <br/>
> to the doctor <br/>
> to the square <br/>
> 🔴 I am going to home ➡ 🟢 I am going home. <br/>
> 🔴 I am going to abroad. ➡ 🟢 I am going abroad. <br/>

I would expect that **to** is used even with the verb **arrive**, but this is not the case.

> We arrived at the bus stop five minutes late. <br/>
> We arrived in Bristol at 10 pm. <br/>
> We arrived home in time for dinner. <br/>

### In, into, on, onto

> I put it in the table. <br/>
> I put it in the car. <br/>
> I put it on the table. <br/>
> I put it on the wall. <br/>

Sometimes we can not distinguish if we answer to question 💡kde or 💡kam. If we want to emphasise
the direction "💡kam", we can use **into** or **onto**.

> He jumped on the stage. 🆚 He jumped onto the stage. <br/>
> He was walking in the room. 🆚 He walked into the room. <br/>

### Towards / toward

💡k, směrem k

These prepositions are equivalent and we use them to talk about a direction, not about a place.

> He walked to the tree and climbed up. 🆚 He was walking towards the tree, but then he suddenly stopped. <br/>

## From which way

### From

💡od, z

It is an opposite to the preposition **to**.

> to school ➡ from school <br/>
> to the dentist ➡ from the dentist <br/>

### Out of

💡ven z

It is an opposite to the preposition **in** / **into**.

> out of the school <br/>
> out of the car <br/>

### Off

💡z povrchu pryč

It is an opposite to the preposition **on** / **onto**.

> off the roof <br/>
> off the table <br/>
> off the wall <br/>

We use **off** together with **on** for large means of transport and means of transport where we sit on. For small means
of transport (taxi, car) we use **out of** together with **in**.

> on / off the bus, on / off the train, on / off the plane <br/>
> on / off the horse, on / off the bike <br/>
> ❗in / out of the car, in / out of the taxi <br/>

## Which way prepositions

### Along

### Up / down

💡nahoru po (něčem), dolů po (něčem)

> up the street <br/>
> up the tree <br/>
> up the stairs <br/>
> down the street <br/>
> down the tree <br/>
> down the stairs <br/>

Be careful, **down** means 💡*dolů po něčem*, in opposite **off** means 💡*dolů z něčeho*.

> fall off / from the tree 🆚 climb down the tree <br/>
> climb off the horse 💡(you don't climb on a horse) <br/>

### Around / round

💡kolem, okolo

These prepositions are equivalent.

> around the world <br/>
> around the house <br/>
> around our village <br/>
> round the corner <br/>

We can use **round** in meanings like 💡*po městě, po bytě, ...*.

> We walked round the town. <br/>
> I showed him round the house. <br/>

nad* or 💡*vyšší pozice* as well.

> They live in a small house above the river. <br/>
> 80% of the area of the Maldives is less than one meter above sea level. <br/>

If something covers something else.

Be aware that **over** has much more meanings.
