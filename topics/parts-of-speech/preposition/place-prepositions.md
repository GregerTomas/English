# Place prepositions

## By 🆚 at

meaning 💡*u*

We use **by** when we talk just about a placement. In opposite, **at** express that we are in connection with the thing.

> He's sitting by the table. 💡*Sedí u/vedle stolu.* <br/>
> He's sitting at the table. 💡*Sedí u stolu a má na něm rozložené věci, pracuje na něm, jí, ...* <br/>
> <br/>
> She was by the door. 💡*Byla u/vedle dveří - jen tam stála.* <br/>
> She was at the door. 💡*Byla u dveří - chtěla jít dál.* <br/>
> <br/>
> 🔴 The chair is at the door. ➡ 🟢 The chair is by the door. <br/>

## At my place

💡*u mě doma, ...*

> at my place 💡*u mě (doma)* <br/>
> at her grandma's place 💡*u její babičky (doma)* <br/>
> I'm at Susan's place right now. I will call back later, ok? <br/>
> Let's meet at my place, have a coffee, and then we can go together. <br/>
> Dinner at my place tonight? – Yeah, great. See you then. <br/>
> You can stay at our place for a few nights if you want. <br/>

We can use **house** instead of **place** or omit it completely. But we muse keep a possessive case.

> I was at Susan's place yesterday. <br/>
> I was at Susan's house yesterday. <br/>
> I was at Susan's yesterday. <br/>
