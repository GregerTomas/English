# Place prepositions

## By 🆚 at

meaning 💡*u*

We use **by** when we talk just about a placement. In opposite, **at** express that we are in connection with the thing.

> He's sitting by the table. 💡*Sedí u/vedle stolu.* <br/>
> He's sitting at the table. 💡*Sedí u stolu a má na něm rozložené věci, pracuje na něm, jí, ...* <br/>
> <br/>
> She was by the door. 💡*Byla u/vedle dveří - jen tam stála.* <br/>
> She was at the door. 💡*Byla u dveří - chtěla jít dál.* <br/>

## At my place

💡*u mě doma, ...*

> Dinner at my place tonight? – Yeah, great. See you then. <br/>
> You can stay at our place for a few nights if you want. <br/>
