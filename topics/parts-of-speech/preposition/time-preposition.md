# Time preposition

## In

We use the preposition **in** in the following cases:
> **years** ➡ in 1998, in 2015 <br/>
> **seasons** ➡ in summer, in the autumn <br/>
> **months** ➡ in March, in September <br/>
> **parts of the day** ➡ in the morning, in the evening (❗**at night** - we consider it as an exact time betweeen two
> days)<br/>

> She got married in 1999. <br/>
> What are you going to do in the summer? <br/>
> It happened in August. <br/>
> I will call him in the morning. <br/>

## On

We use the preposition **on** in the following cases:

> **days** ➡ on Monday, on Tuesday, on my birthday, on Christmas Day <br/>
> **dates** ➡ on 23rd April, on July 4th <br/>
> **parts of the day with some sort of attribute** ➡ on Monday morning, on Wednesday afternoon, on a rainy morning, on a
> sunny afternoon <br/>

> I'll see you on Monday. <br/>
> She was born on 23rd April / April 23rd. <br/>
> I always stay in bed longer on Saturday mornings. <br/>

## At

We use the preposition **at** for exact times and in established phrases.

> at 5 <br/>
> at 3 am <br/>
> at nine o'clock <br/>
> at noon / at midday <br/>
> at midnight <br/>

> at night <br/>
> at the moment <br/>
> at the weekend <br/>
> at Christmas <br/>
> at Easter <br/>

> She came home at 3 in the morning. <br/>
> The show finished at midnight. <br/>

We use **at** for holidays which takes more than on day. If we talk about one exact day or about one-day holiday, we use
the preposition **on**.

> at Christmas, at Easter <br/>
> on Christmas Day, on Easter Monday <br/>
> on Halloween <br/>

## Without a preposition

Some words can be used instead of one of these prepositions.

> **this** ➡ this week, this month, this Monday, this September, this morning <br/>
> **last** ➡ last week, last month, last night, last Monday, last September <br/>
> **next** ➡ next week, next month, next Monday <br/>
> **every** ➡ every day, every year <br/>
> **yesterday** ➡ yesterday morning, tomorrow night <br/>
> and many others...
