> I'm waiting for Dad. 🆚 I'm waiting on Dad. 💡*čekám na jeho rozhodnutí (a pak se podle něj zařídím)* <br/>

### Arrive

We consider that **arrive** describes the situation when we are already in the target place (like the verb **be**). We
use the prepositions **
in** and **at** or **on** with this verb, it depends on what preposition is used with the target place.

> 🔴 I arrived to Prague. ➡ 🟢 I arrived in Prague.
> 🔴 I arrived to the airport. ➡ 🟢 I arrived at the airport.
> <br/>
> I went to Prague at 6 in the morning, but I didn't get there until 9. ➡ I was / arrived in Prague at 9. <br/>
> I got to Prague at 9 although I left at 6. ➡ I was / arrived in Prague at 9. <br/>
> I came to Prague at 9. Just in time for the meeting. ➡ I was / arrived in Prague at 9. <br/>
> <br/>
> We went to the airport at 6 to catch our 10 o'clock plane. ➡ We were / arrived at the airport at 9. <br/>
> We got to the airport at 9. Just in time to catch our plane. ➡ We were / arrived at the airport at 9. <br/>

## At the end 🆚 in the end

> We signed the contract at the end of the meeting. 🆚 We signed the contract at the end.
> We sang a song at the end and went home. 💡*například na konci školní hodiny* 🆚 We sang a song in the end and went
> home. 💡*Nevyjadřujeme, kdy jsme si zazpívali, ale dáváme důraz na to, že jsme se například rozhodovali (jestli si
zazpíváme, nebo ne). Nakonec jsme se ale rozhodli si zazpívat.*

### At the end

💡*na konci něčeho*

> at the end of the movie <br/>
> at the end of the street <br/>
> at the end of the meeting <br/>
> at the end of March <br/>

We use it together with a preposition **of**, which is not always necessary.

> At the end of the movie they get married. <br/>
> Our house is at the end of the street. <br/>
> At the end of the meeting they made an agreement. <br/>
> They are coming at the end of March. <br/>
> We sang a song at the end of the class and went home. ➡ We sang a song at the end and went home. <br/>

### In the end

💡*nakonec, v důsledku něčeho*

Something happened after a some kind of process (for example thought process).

> We wanted to go to Greece, but we flew to Spain in the end. <br/>
> In the end, we made an agreement, but it took at least 3 hours. <br/>
> I wanted to go to the party, but in the end I didn't. <br/>
> He was three hours late in the end. <br/>
> What did you do in the end? <br/>
> Who did they choose in the end? <br/>

We can use **eventually** instead of this phrase.

> Eventually, we made an agreement, but it took at least 3 hours. <br/>
> He was eventually three hours late. <br/>
> What did you do eventually? <br/>
> Who did they choose eventually? <br/>
> You'll have to do it eventually anyway. <br/>

### Tests

We can simply put the word **test** before a subject name.

> We have a history test tomorrow. <br/>
> She failed her English test. <br/>
> Most of the questions in the Geography test were really easy. <br/>

If it is test on a specific topic, we use the preposition **on**.

> He needed to study for the test on state capitals. <br/>
> What was the test on? <br/>
> He gave us a pop quiz on fractions. <br/>

### Qualifications and exams

We use the preposition **in**.

## By 🆚 with

We often use these prepositions in a connection with adverbial determinations of manner.

### By

The preposition **by** express a manner or a method, how we can manage to do something / achieve something.

> He got to where he is by hard work and perseverance. <br/>
> We will contact you by e-mail. <br/>
> I paid by credit card. <br/>
> We can get there by train or by plane. <br/>
> The burglar must have escaped by the back door. <br/>

We often use the gerundium after it.

> You can only win by taking risks. <br/>
> He started his talk by quoting Albert Einstein. <br/>
> You can open the doors by pressing this button. <br/>
> You can relieve an itch by scratching it, but it will probably just make it worse. <br/>
> She tried to see over the wall by standing on her toes. <br/>

As an opposite, we can use **without**.

> He knew how to ride the bike without holding the handlebars. <br/>
> He never won without cheating. <br/>

We can use the preposition **through** (💡*prostřednictvím čeho, skrze*) instead of **by**.

> You can achieve a lot through hard work. <br/>
> He improved through practicing every day. <br/>
> Some tried to gain advantages through bribery. <br/>
> Did you get the job through someone? <br/>

### With

We use the preposition **with** in a connection with a tool which we do something with.

> He tried to swat the fly with a newspaper. <br/>
> Do you know how to chop firewood with an axe? <br/>
> The boy drew a circle with a compass. <br/>

As an opposite, we can use **without**.

> Can you draw a straight line without a ruler? <br/>
> You can't fix it without a screwdriver. <br/>

We can use the present participle of the verb **use (using)** as a preposition before tools.

> You can measure this angle using a protractor. <br/>
> The teacher spoke to her using sign language. <br/>

> damaged with an axe <br/>
> The cabin was destroyed by fire. <br/>
> The temple was built by the Aztecs. <br/>
