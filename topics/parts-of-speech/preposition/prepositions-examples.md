### Arrive

We consider that **arrive** describes the situation when we are already in the target place (like the verb **be**). We
use the prepositions **
in** and **at** or **on** with this verb, it depends on what preposition is used with the target place.

> üî¥ I arrived to Prague. ‚û° üü¢ I arrived in Prague.
> üî¥ I arrived to the airport. ‚û° üü¢ I arrived at the airport.
> <br/>
> I went to Prague at 6 in the morning, but I didn't get there until 9. ‚û° I was / arrived in Prague at 9. <br/>

zazp√≠v√°me, nebo ne). Nakonec jsme se ale rozhodli si zazp√≠vat.*

### At the end

üí°*na konci nƒõƒçeho*

> at the end of the movie <br/>
> at the end of the street <br/>

We use it together with a preposition **of**, which is not always necessary.

### In the end

üí°*nakonec, v d≈Øsledku nƒõƒçeho*

> He was three hours late in the end. <br/>
> What did you do in the end? <br/>

We can use **eventually** instead of this phrase.

> Who did they choose eventually? <br/>

### Tests

We can simply put the word **test** before a subject name.

> We have a history test tomorrow. <br/>
> She failed her English test. <br/>
> Most of the questions in the Geography test were really easy. <br/>

If it is test on a specific topic, we use the preposition **on**.

> He needed to study for the test on state capitals. <br/>
> What was the test on? <br/>
> He gave us a pop quiz on fractions. <br/>

### Qualifications and exams

We use the preposition **in**.

## By üÜö with

We often use these prepositions in a connection with adverbial determinations of manner.

### By

The preposition **by** express a manner or a method, how we can manage to do something / achieve something.

> He got to where he is by hard work and perseverance. <br/>
> We will contact you by e-mail. <br/>
> I paid by credit card. <br/>
> We can get there by train or by plane. <br/>
> The burglar must have escaped by the back door. <br/>

We often use the gerundium after it.

> You can only win by taking risks. <br/>
> He started his talk by quoting Albert Einstein. <br/>
> You can open the doors by pressing this button. <br/>
> You can relieve an itch by scratching it, but it will probably just make it worse. <br/>
> She tried to see over the wall by standing on her toes. <br/>

As an opposite, we can use **without**.

> He knew how to ride the bike without holding the handlebars. <br/>
> He never won without cheating. <br/>

We can use the preposition **through** (üí°*prost≈ôednictv√≠m ƒçeho, skrze*) instead of **by**.

> You can achieve a lot through hard work. <br/>
> He improved through practicing every day. <br/>
> Some tried to gain advantages through bribery. <br/>
> Did you get the job through someone? <br/>

### With

We use the preposition **with** in a connection with a tool which we do something with.

> He tried to swat the fly with a newspaper. <br/>
> Do you know how to chop firewood with an axe? <br/>
> The boy drew a circle with a compass. <br/>

As an opposite, we can use **without**.

> Can you draw a straight line without a ruler? <br/>
> You can't fix it without a screwdriver. <br/>

We can use the present participle of the verb **use (using)** as a preposition before tools.

> He opened the box using a screwdriver. <br/>
> They fought using swords and shields. <br/>
> You can measure this angle using a protractor. <br/>
> The teacher spoke to her using sign language. <br/>

## In passive

The preposition **by** is used for expressing üí°ƒçinitele (kdo nebo co nƒõco zp≈Øsobilo). In opposite, we use **with** for a
tool which was used to do something.

> damaged by a burglar <br/>
> damaged by a tornado <br/>
> damaged with an axe <br/>
> The cabin was destroyed by fire. <br/>
> The temple was built by the Aztecs. <br/>
> This is one of the best pieces composed by Mozart. <br/>
> You could be hit by a truck tomorrow. You never know. <br/>
> The door was unlocked with a bobby pin. <br/>

> The cyclist survived **thanks to** his helmet. <br/>
> **Thanks to** your generous donation, we can rebuild the library. <br/>

We do not use it in a negative context, but we do in an ironing context.

> üî¥ The trip was canceled thanks to bad weather. <br/>
> We lost **thanks to** your incompetence. <br/>
> **Thanks to** you and your stupid prank, I spent the evening mopping the floor. <br/>

## Due to

üí° kv≈Øli

We use it in a neutral or negative context.

> The trip was canceled **due to** bad weather. <br/>

**on somebody's account** üí°*kv≈Øli nƒõkomu*

**on no account** üí°*v ≈æ√°dn√©m p≈ô√≠padƒõ*

> **On no account** should you try to do this at home. <br/>

## Like (üí° podobn√Ω)

In this meaning, we use together with verbs like **look** and **be**.

> She **looks like** Lara Croft. <br/>
> **He's like** his father, tall, smart and handsome. <br/>
> I want to **be** less **like** me and more **like** you. <br/>
