# Time preposition

## In

We use the preposition **in** in the following cases:
> **years** ➡ in 1998, in 2015 <br/>
> **seasons** ➡ in summer, in the autumn <br/>
> **months** ➡ in March, in September <br/>
> **parts of the day** ➡ in the morning, in the evening (❗**at night** - we consider it as an exact time betweeen two
> days)<br/>

> She got married in 1999. <br/>
> What are you going to do in the summer? <br/>
> It happened in August. <br/>
> I will call him in the morning. <br/>

## On

We use the preposition **on** in the following cases:

> **days** ➡ on Monday, on Tuesday, on my birthday, on Christmas Day <br/>
> **dates** ➡ on 23rd April, on July 4th <br/>
> **parts of the day with some sort of attribute** ➡ on Monday morning, on Wednesday afternoon, on a rainy morning, on a
> sunny afternoon <br/>

> I'll see you on Monday. <br/>
> She was born on 23rd April / April 23rd. <br/>
> I always stay in bed longer on Saturday mornings. <br/>

## At

We use the preposition **at** for exact times and in established phrases.

> at 5 <br/>
> at 3 am <br/>
> at nine o'clock <br/>
> at noon / at midday <br/>
> at midnight <br/>

> at night <br/>
> at the moment <br/>
> at the weekend <br/>
> at Christmas <br/>
> at Easter <br/>

> She came home at 3 in the morning. <br/>
> The show finished at midnight. <br/>

We use **at** for holidays which takes more than on day. If we talk about one exact day or about one-day holiday, we use
the preposition **on**.

> at Christmas, at Easter <br/>
> on Christmas Day, on Easter Monday <br/>
> on Halloween <br/>

## Until and by

💡 do, až do nějaké doby

### Until

**Until** can be both a preposition and a conjunction. This article is about the preposition. We can use **till** as
well, it is just an 🗣 informal variant of **until**.

> You can stay here until / till Friday. <br/>
> The ticket is valid until / till December. <br/>
> She didn't come back until 5 o'clock. <br/>

#### Not ... until

We use this phrase when we want to express that something happens late. Can be either a preposition or a conjuction.

> He came at midnight. ➡ He didn't come until midnight. 💡*Nepřišel před půlnocí. Přišel **až** o půlnoci.* <br/>
> She didn't finish the report until Friday afternoon. <br/>
> I usually don't come home until eight. <br/>
> Our boss isn't coming until next Monday. <br/>
> I won't see him until five. <br/>
> I couldn't fall asleep until two. <br/>
> I didn't notice my mistake until it was too late. <br/>
> She didn't see her brother again until she was 35. <br/>
> You won't see the money until you are 18. <br/>
> When is he coming back? Not until next Monday. <br/>
> When are you going to talk to him again? – Not until he apologizes. <br/>

##### Not ... until 🆚 not ... for another ...

💡až za

We talk about the length of a period.

> 🔴 He didn't come until a few hours. ➡ 🟢 He didn't come for another few hours. 💡*Přišel až za několik hodin.* <br/>
> We can watch a movie. I'm not going anywhere for another two hours. <br/>
> He didn't see his parents for another nine years. <br/>
> She didn't show up for another day. <br/>
> I can't give it back to you for another two days. <br/>
> We still have time. The show doesn't start for another hour. <br/>
> They probably won't finish for another three weeks. <br/>
> My birthday's not for another month. <br/>
> When is he coming back? – Not for another five days. <br/>

You can encounter the **not ... for** phrase too.

> We won't get home for three weeks. <br/>

#### Until 🆚 to

We can use **to** instead of **until** when we use the preposition **from**.

> I waited there from five until / till / to six. <br/>
> 🔴 I waited there to six. ➡ 🟢 I waited there until / till six. <br/>

TODO until now / so far

#### Until 🆚 by

We use the preposition

* **until** when we are talking about something that lasts (is happening and will happen) until some point in the
  future, then it will stop.
* **by** when we are talking about something that will happen at some point in the future, or sooner.

> I'll be at home until/till Sunday. 💡*Budu doma do neděle. Jsem nebo budu doma do neděle, ale v neděli odjedu.* <br/>
> I'll be at home by Sunday. 💡*Budu doma do neděle. Nejsem doma, ale nejpozději do neděle přijedu.* <br/>

> You can stay until 10. You have to leave by 10. <br/>
> You can stay here until Friday but you have to leave by 6 o'clock. <br/>
> Keep the brochures until this afternoon. I need them back by 6 pm though. <br/>
> You can borrow the laptop until the end of next week. Return it to my assistant by Friday next week. <br/>

### By

> 🔴 I need the report until / till Friday. ➡ 🟢 I need the report by Friday. <br/>
> I have to leave by 3 o'clock. <br/>
> Do you think you'll be able to finish it by Monday? <br/>
> I need it back by the end of the week. <br/>
> Can you repair my car by Friday? <br/>

In opposite to **until**, **by** is just a preposition, but sometimes we need a conjunction, in this case we can use **
by the time**.

> I'll be at home until Sunday. ➡ I'll be at home by Sunday. (*preposition*)<br/>
> I'll be at home until you come. ➡ I'll be at home by the time you come. (*conjunction*) <br/>

## Without a preposition

Some words can be used instead of one of these prepositions.

> **this** ➡ this week, this month, this Monday, this September, this morning <br/>
> **last** ➡ last week, last month, last night, last Monday, last September <br/>
> **next** ➡ next week, next month, next Monday <br/>
> **every** ➡ every day, every year <br/>
> **yesterday** ➡ yesterday morning, tomorrow night <br/>
> and many others...
