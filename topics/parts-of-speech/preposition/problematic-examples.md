### Arrive

We consider that **arrive** describes the situation when we are already in the target place (like the verb **be**). We
use the prepositions **
in** and **at** or **on** with this verb, it depends on what preposition is used with the target place.

> 🔴 I arrived to Prague. ➡ 🟢 I arrived in Prague.
> 🔴 I arrived to the airport. ➡ 🟢 I arrived at the airport.
> <br/>

## At the end 🆚 in the end

> We signed the contract at the end of the meeting. 🆚 We signed the contract at the end.
> We sang a song at the end and went home. 💡*například na konci školní hodiny* 🆚 We sang a song in the end and went
> home. 💡*Nevyjadřujeme, kdy jsme si zazpívali, ale dáváme důraz na to, že jsme se například rozhodovali (jestli si
zazpíváme, nebo ne). Nakonec jsme se ale rozhodli si zazpívat.*

### At the end

💡*na konci něčeho*

> at the end of the movie <br/>
> at the end of the street <br/>
> at the end of the meeting <br/>
> at the end of March <br/>

We use it together with a preposition **of**, which is not always necessary.

> At the end of the movie they get married. <br/>
> Our house is at the end of the street. <br/>
> At the end of the meeting they made an agreement. <br/>
> They are coming at the end of March. <br/>
> We sang a song at the end of the class and went home. ➡ We sang a song at the end and went home. <br/>

### In the end

💡*nakonec, v důsledku něčeho*

Something happened after a some kind of process (for example thought process).

> We wanted to go to Greece, but we flew to Spain in the end. <br/>
> In the end, we made an agreement, but it took at least 3 hours. <br/>
> I wanted to go to the party, but in the end I didn't. <br/>
> He was three hours late in the end. <br/>
> What did you do in the end? <br/>
> Who did they choose in the end? <br/>

We can use **eventually** instead of this phrase.

> Eventually, we made an agreement, but it took at least 3 hours. <br/>
> He was eventually three hours late. <br/>
> What did you do eventually? <br/>
> Who did they choose eventually? <br/>
> You'll have to do it eventually anyway. <br/>
