# Creation from adjectives

## Suffix -ly

Adverb (usually a manner one) can be created from adjectives by adding the suffix **-ly**. There are two grammar
changes: **-y ➡ -ily** and **-le ➡ -ly**.

| adjective   | adverb        |
|-------------|---------------|
| quick       | quickly       |
| nice        | nicely        |
| bad         | badly         |
| complete    | completely    |
| legal       | legally       |
| interesting | interestingly |
| funny       | funnily       |
| easy        | easily        | 
| happy       | happily       |
| comfortable | comfortably   |
| terrible    | terribly      |

## Without a suffix

### Different form

> You did good work. 🆚 You worked well. <br/>

### Same form

Some adverbs have the same form as their equivalent adjectives.

> fast 💡*rychlý / rychle* <br/>
> early 💡*časný / časně* <br/>
> long 💡*dlouhý / dlouze* <br/>
> straight 💡*přímý / přímo* <br/>

> It's not a very fast car. 🆚 He didn't drive very fast. <br/>
> I need to catch an early train. 🆚 I need to get up early. <br/>
> It's going to be a long day. 🆚 You'll have to wait long. <br/>
> Now draw a straight line. 🆚 Now walk straight ahead. <br/>

### Same form or -ly suffix

Same adverbs can be created with the **-ly** suffix or have the same form as their equivalent adjectives. A "same form"
adverb has closer meaning to its adjective, the one with **-ly** suffix has rather figurative meaning (💡*přenesený
význam*).

| adjective        | the same form         | with **-ly** suffix           |
|------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| hard             | hard 💡*tvrdě, těžce* | hardly 💡*stěží, téměř vůbec* |
| late             | late 💡*pozdě*        | lately 💡*poslední dobou*     |
| high             | high 💡*vysoko*       | highly 💡*vysoce (velmi)*     |
| deep             | deep 💡*hluboko*      | deeply 💡*hluboce (velmi)*    |
| wide             | wide 💡*zeširoka*     | widely 💡*obecně*             |
| near             | near 💡*blízko*       | nearly 💡*téměř, skoro*       |
| near 💡*blízký*  | near 💡*blízko*       | nearly 💡*téměř*              |
| close 💡*blízký* | close 💡*blízko*      | closely 💡*pozorně / úzce*    |

#### Hard 🆚 hardly

> She hit him **hard** in the face. 💡*Tvrdě ho udeřila do obličeje.* <br/>
> I worked really **hard** and made great improvement. <br/>
> Don't try too **hard** or you'll hurt yourself. <br/>

**Hardly** is considered as a negative word, we cannot combine it with nobody, never, etc.

> 🔴 **Hardly nobody** passed the test. ➡ 🟢 **Hardly anybody** passed the test. 💡*Skoro nikdo tím testem neprošel.* <br/>

sentences or in questions, no such a rule applies.

### Replacement

Some adjectives end with the suffix **-ly**, and we cannot add another **-ly--** suffix. In these cases, we
must use a replacement **in a + adjective + way / manner / fashion**. The same applies for some adjectives which end
with **-ed**.

> friendly ➡ 🔴 friendlily ➡ 🟢 in a friendly way <br/>
> silly ➡ 🔴 sillily ➡ 🟢 in a silly way <br/>
> lonely ➡ in a lonely way <br/>
> cowardly ➡ in a cowardly way <br/>
> deadly ➡ in a deadly way <br/>
> frightened ➡ 🔴 frightenedly ➡ 🟢 in a frightened way <br/>

> She talked to me in a friendly way. <br/>
> She talked to me in a silly way. <br/>
> He laughed in a silly manner. <br/>
> They ran away in a cowardly fashion. <br/>

If you are not sure whether you can use the **-ly** suffix with an adjectives which ends with **-ed**, it is better
to use a replacement.

> tired ➡ tiredly 🔃 in a tired way <br/>
> hurried ➡ hurriedly <br/>
> supposed ➡ supposedly <br/>
> unexpected ➡ unexpectedly <br/>
> repeated ➡ repeatedly <br/>

## Adjective instead of adverb

🗣 In informal English, we can face the use of adjectives instead of adverbs.

> Come here, quick! 🔃 quickly <br/>
> I bought it really cheap. 🔃 cheaply <br/>
> Drive safe! 🔃 safely <br/>
> Now turn around real slow. 🔃slowly <br/>
> Don't speak so loud! 🔃 loudly <br/>
