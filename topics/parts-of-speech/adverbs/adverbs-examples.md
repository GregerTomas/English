An article is placed after **quite**.

### Intensifiers

💡 zcela

Between intensifiers also belong words like **very**, **completely**, **totally**, etc.

> That's quite correct. 💡*To je zcela správně.* <br/>

> The restaurant was quite full. <br/>
> His story was quite fascinating. <br/>

> That was quite a performance! <br/>
> It was quite the worst hotel I'd ever stayed in. <br/>

### How to differentiate it?

Generally, from the context.

Even adjective after it can help.

**gradable adjective ➡ down-toner**

> You are quite tall. <br/>

**non-gradable adjective ➡ intensifiers**

> Your homework is quite correct. <br/>

**Quite** as a down-toner is also not used in American English.
