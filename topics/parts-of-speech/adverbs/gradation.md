# Gradation

## Short adverbs

They consist of one syllable or two syllables if the adverb has the same form as the corresponding adjective.
Suffixes **-er** and **-est** are used for gradation.

| basic form            | comparative         | superlative               |
|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| fast 💡*rychle*       | faster 💡*rychleji* | fastest 💡*nejrychleji*   |
| hard                  | 	harder             | hardest                   |
| deep                  | 	deeper             | deepest                   |
| early 💡*časně, brzy* | earlier 💡*dříve*   | 💡*earliest* 💡*nejdříve* |

## Long adverbs

They usually consist of two or more syllables adverbs (typically these with **-ly** suffix). Adverbs **more** and **
most** are
used for gradation.

| basic form         | comparative               | superlative                  |
|--------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| quickly 💡*rychle* | more quickly 💡*rychleji* | most quickly 💡*nejrychleji* |
| happily            | more happily              | most happily                 |
| interestingly      | more interestingly        | most interestingly           |

❗ Note that adjectives ending on **-y** or **-ly** are graded with **-er** or **-est** suffix.

> **adjective** - friendly ➡ friendlier ➡ friendliest <br/>
> **adverb** - quickly ➡ more quickly ➡ most quickly (🔴 quicklier / quickliest) <br/>

## Irregular gradation

| basic form            | comparative               | superlative                    |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| well 💡*dobře*        | better 💡*lépe*           | best 💡*nejlépe*               | 
| badly 💡*špatně*      | worse 💡*hůře*            | worst 💡*nejhůře*              | 
| little 💡*málo*       | less 💡*méně*             | least 💡*nejméně*              | 
| much / many 💡*mnoho* | more 💡*více*             | most 💡*nejvíce*               |                    
| far 💡*daleko*        | farther, further 💡*dále* | farthest, furthest 💡*nejdále* | 

Note that **much** and **many** have the same gradation as opposed to **little** and **less**. **Little** is irregular
and **less** is regular**.

| basic form  | comparative | superlative |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| much / many | more        | most        |       
| little      | less        | least       | 
| few         | fewer       | fewest      |     

**Farther** has two possible options. **Farther / farthest** is used for a distance, and **further / furthest** is used
for time or order of things.

> She lives farther away than he does. <br/>
> I won't read any further. <br/>

## Ungradable adverbs

There are a lot of them, for example **monthly**, **nearly**, **enough**, **never**, **sometimes**, etc.

## ✏ Superlative + definite article

Normally, we do not use the definite article with an adverb. But it can be used to emphasize we compare something with
something else.

> He works **(the) hardest** of all. <br/>
> Where were you when we needed you **(the) most**? <br/>
