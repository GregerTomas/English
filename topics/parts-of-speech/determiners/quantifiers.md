## A lot (of) üó£

üí°hodnƒõ

We can use it with both countable and uncountable nouns.

> I've got a lot of money. <br/>
> I've got a lot of friends. <br/>

The preposition **of** is used only before a noun.

> üî¥ "Do you like pizza?" Yes, a lot of. ‚û° üü¢ "Do you like pizza?" Yes, a lot.
> üî¥ It hurts a lot of. ‚û° üü¢ It hurts a lot.

The verb is determined by a noun.

> A lot of people are very lazy. <br/>
> A lot of my friends work here. <br/>
> A lot of water was wasted. <br/>

You can use **lots of** in üó£informal English.

> I've got lots of money. <br/>
> I've got lots of friends. <br/>

## Much / many

üí°hodnƒõ

We use much / many in questions, negative sentences or in established phrases. Using **many** in a positive announcement
sentence is rather ‚úè formal, using **much** is even incorrect.

> üî¥ I've got much money. ‚û° üü¢ I've got a lot of money.
> ‚úè I've got many friends. ‚û° I've got a lot of friends.

**questions**
> How many friends do you have? <br/>
> How much money do you have? <br/>

**negative sentences**
> I don't have many friends. <br/>
> I don't have much money. <br/>

**too much / too many**

üí°p≈ô√≠li≈°

> There were too many people. <br/>
> I have too much work. <br/>

**so much / so many**

üí°tolik

> There were so many people! <br/>
> I have so much work! <br/>

**as much as / as many as**

üí°tolik ‚Ä¶ jako

> You can drink as much beer as you want. <br/>
> You can take as many books as you want. <br/>

**very much**

> Thank you very much. <br/>
> I like the book very much. <br/>

**comparative grading**

> He's much taller. <br/>
> That book is much more interesting than this one. <br/>

We don't normally use a preposition **of** after many / much, but we do when we speak about a part of a whole.

> Many of my friends. <br/>
> I haven't spent much of the money I got for my birthday yet. <br/>
> üî¥ Many of friends. *(we must use my, her, the, ...)* <br/>

## Plenty (of) üó£

üí°dostatek, v√≠ce ne≈æ je pot≈ôeba

> There's no rush. We've got plenty of time. <br/>
> Since I've got the new job, I have plenty of money. <br/>

## A great deal (of) ‚úè

üí°mnoho

Can be used with uncountable nouns.

> There seems to be a great deal of confusion about the new policy. <br/>

## A large amount (of) / a large number (of) ‚úè

* a large amount of - uncountable nouns
* a large number of - countable nouns

We can use it when a **lot of** is too informal.

> He spent a large amount of time working. <br/>
> A large number of species disappeared. <br/>

The object of a sentence is still the noun after of preposition and verb is determined by it.

> Every year, a large number of people are killed in traffic. <br/>
