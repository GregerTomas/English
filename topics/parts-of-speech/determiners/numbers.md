## Nouns with numbers

Following variants are often interchangeable, but sometimes one is more preferred than the other one.

### With ordinal numeral

> definite determiner + ordinal numeral + noun <br/>

> I bought the game on the first day. <br/>
> The table of contents is on the second page. <br/>
> Take the first street on the left. <br/>
> How was your first day at work? <br/>
> Their second album wasn't as good as the first. <br/>
> John's first mistake was that he went alone. <br/>
> 🔴 My the first day at work was terrible. <br/>
> 🔴 That was John's the first mistake. <br/>

In the names of the king or queen, we use the ordinal numeral at the end.

> John I ➡ John the First <br/>
> Henry VIII ➡ Henry the Eighth <br/>

This variant is preferred when there is some kind of order of things we are talking about, for example: **first door on
the right**, ...

### With basic numeral

> noun + basic numeral *(no determiner)* <br/>

There is not a determiner in these phrases. We can use the work **number** before the noun.

> I bought the game on day one. <br/>
> The table of contents is on page two. <br/>
> Many people died in World War II. <br/>
> I choose task number (no.) 12. <br/>
> Please, open page no. 245. <br/>

But with years, we use the definite article.

> in 1982 <br/>
> in **the** year 1982 <br/>

This variant is preferred when we identify something, for example **a room in a hotel**, **a page in a book, ...**

## Multiplicative numerals (multiplicative adverbs)

Basically, there are only three forms of multiplicative numerals.

> once <br/>
> twice <br/>
> **x** times (four times, one hundred and seventy-two times, a million times) <br/>

We can use other numerals as well.

> many times <br/>
> several times 💡několikrát <br/>
> a few times <br/>
> a couple (of) times 💡párkrát <br/>
> countless times 💡nesčíslněkrát <br/>

In questions, we use **How many times ...?**

### Expressing a frequency

> multiplicative numeral / adverb + indefinite article + time indication <br/>

> once a day <br/>
> twice a week <br/>
> five times a month <br/>

We can use the preposition **per** in ✏ formal English.

> twice per week <br/>

### Once or one time, twice or two times

Rarely **one times** or **two times** are possible. For example, we can say following.

> once or twice ➡ one or two times <br/>
> twice or three times ➡ two or three times <br/>

We can use **one time** (💡jednou se něco stalo) if we want to say that there was only one occurrence.

> I remember one time I was driving from work and I hit a deer! <br/>
> One time I was invited to speak at a conference in Madrid. <br/>

**Once** has a meaning 💡kdysi too (indefinite time in the past).

> I once lived here. <br/>
> He was famous once, but now no one cares. <br/>

**Once** can be a conjunction too (💡až, když).

> I will give you your gift once you give me mine. <br/>

### Comparison of adjectives or adverbs (or nouns)

We use phrase **as** or **as ... as**

### More

> My wife and I work the same hours but I earn twice as much. <br/>
> You can take the train but if you drive, you will get there three times as fast. <br/>
> My laptop is ten times as heavy as my tablet. <br/>

We can use the phrase with a comparative for numbers greater than 2.

> 🔴 twice more ➡ 🟢 twice as much <br/>
> three times faster <br/>
> ten times heavier <br/>

### Less

We use fractions if something is smaller, slower, lighter, etc.

> 🔴 twice as small ➡ 🟢 half as large 💡*dvakrát menší* <br/>
> 🔴 three times as slow ➡ 🟢 a/one third as fast 💡*třikrát pomalejší* <br/>
> 🔴 five times as bad ➡ 🟢 a/one fifth as good 💡*pětkrát horší* <br/>

We can change the order of both things, it will be more natural and understandable.

> My new Internet connection is only a third as fast as my previous one. ➡ My previous internet connection was three
> times as fast as my new one. <br/>

### Comparison of nouns

We can compare the nouns directly.

> Utah is twice as large as Ohio. ➡ Utah is twice the size of Ohio. <br/>
> Ohio is half as large as Utah. ➡ Ohio is half the size of Utah. <br/>
> My previous internet connection was three times the speed of my new one. <br/>
> My laptop is ten times the weight of my tablet. <br/>
> My new Internet connection is only one third the speed of my previous one. <br/>
> Teachers make about one quarter the salary of pharmacists. <br/>
> The e-book was one fifth the price of the paper edition. <br/>

### Twofold, threefold, tenfold, etc.

> twofold 💡dvakrát, dvojnásobně, dvojnásobný <br/>
> threefold 💡třikrát, trojnásobně, trojnásobný <br/>
> fourfold 💡čtyřikrát <br/>
> fivefold 💡pětkrát <br/>
> sixfold 💡šestkrát <br/>
> tenfold 💡desetkrát <br/>

We use these words primarily when we talk about an increase, a grew, a drop, etc.

> Their income has increased sixfold over the last five years. <br/>
> The population grew almost twofold. <br/>

These words can be used as an adjective too.

> We expect a threefold increase in traffic in the town center. <br/>

## Decimals

> whole number / integer 💡*celé číslo* <br/>
> decimal number / decimal 💡*desetinné číslo* <br/>
> decimal point 💡*desetinná čárka* <br/>
> decimal place 💡*desetinné místo* <br/>
> tenth 💡*desetina* <br/>
> hundredth 💡*setina* <br/>
> thousandth 💡*tisícina* <br/>
> hundred-thousandth 💡*stotisícina* <br/>
> millionth 💡*miliontina* <br/>

The point is used as a decimal point, the comma is used as a thousands separator.

> 1,001 💡*tisíc jedna* <br/>
> 1.001 💡*jedna celá, jedna tisícina* <br/>

| number | general variant                 | mathematical variant                      | notes                                                                                          |
|--------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 54.026 | fifty-four **point** oh two six | fifty-four **and** twenty-six thousandths ||
| 1.25   | one **point** two five          | one and twenty-five hundredths            | 🔴one point twenty-five (this rule does not apply for money - *one pound twenty-five (£1.25)*) |

### Decimals and nouns

The noun is always without a preposition and in plural. We can use the preposition **of** for decimals smaller than 1.

> 1.6 km = one point six kilometres, 0.9 kilometres, 1.1 kilometres 🆚 1 kilometre <br/>
> 2.37 l = two point three seven litres <br/>
> 0.7 h = zero point seven hours <br/>
> 0.7 h = zero point seven of an hour = zero point seven hours <br/>

Percent (the preposition **per** + a noun **cent**) does not have plural.

> 1 percent <br/>
> 5 percent <br/>
> 0.78 percent = zero point seven eight percent <br/>

### Tens, hundreds, thousands

### With ordinal numeral

> 2 hundred cars <br/>
> 10 thousand people <br/>
> two dozen computers 💡*přibižně 2 desítky / 2 tucty*<br/>

Tens, hundreds, thousands are always in singular and without a preposition.

The ordinal number can be replaced with different numeral or with an indefinite aricle.

> many hundred years ago <br/>
> a few thousand people <br/>
> several million pounds <br/>
> a couple of thousand MP3s <br/>

### Numeral in plural

Plural with the preposition **of**.

> Dozens of people showed up to support the village team. <br/>
> Hundreds of birds were circling above my head. <br/>
> Every year the company spends thousands of dollars on security. <br/>
> There might be millions of species we haven't discovered yet. <br/>
> Thanks to the Hubble Space Telescope we can see galaxies that are billions of light years away. <br/>
> Facebook has tens of millions of users worldwide. <br/>
> The Milky Way contains hundreds of billions of stars. <br/>

In opposite to [With ordinal numeral](#with-ordinal-numeral) we can use **tens** instead of **dozens** too.

> dozens of birds <br/>
> tens of thousands <br/>

The combinations ten thousand, one hundred thousand, ten million, one hundred million are derived from real numbers.

> 🔴 one thousand hundred ➡ 🟢 one hundred thousand <br/>

## How long does something take

> The journey takes two days. <br/>

### As an adjective

We just add hyphen (💡spojovník) and remove plural from the noun (adjectives are not typically in plural). This newly
created adjective can stand only before a noun.

> two days ➡ two-day 💡*dvoudenní* <br/>

> It was a two-day journey. <br/>
> They went on a three-week cruise in the Caribbean. <br/>
> After a four-year hiatus the band released a new album. <br/>
> Sheldon won a grant to pay for a three-month expedition to the North Pole. <br/>
> There was a fifteen-minute delay. <br/>
> When the battery is low, the second hand moves at two-second intervals. <br/>
> You can't speak fluent English after five forty-five-minute lessons! <br/>
> 🔴 The journey was two-day. ➡ 🟢 That was the two-day journey.
> a seven-pound baby <br/>
> a two-meter alligator <br/>
> a hundred-dollar bill <br/>
> a six-and-a-half-mile run <br/>
> a hundred-degree fever <br/>
> a two-gram dose <br/>
> a ten-foot ladder <br/>
> a half-litre bottle <br/>
> a ten-month-old boy <br/>

### Noun with genitive

> two days ➡ two days' <br/>

We do use an indefinite article in this case only for indication of time in singular.

> 🔴 a two days' journey 💡*The journey takes two days.* <br/>
> 🟢 a day's journey 💡*The journey takes **a** day* <br/>

| noun      | noun + adjective  | noun with genitive   | 🔴 wrong               |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| a book    | 	a nice book      | 	John's book         | 🔴 a John's book       | 
| a journey | a two-day journey | 	two days' journey   | 🔴 a two days' journey |
| a journey | a one-day journey | 	a one day's journey | 🔴 two days' journey   |

This variant is typical for indication of time.

> yesterday's news <br/>
> tomorrow's problems <br/>
> in two weeks' time <br/>
> last year's election <br/>
> his life's work <br/>
> a lifetime's dream <br/>
