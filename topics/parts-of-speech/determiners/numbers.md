## Nouns with numbers

Following variants are often interchangeable, but sometimes one is more preferred than the other one.

### With ordinal numeral

> definite determiner + ordinal numeral + noun <br/>

> I bought the game on the first day. <br/>
> The table of contents is on the second page. <br/>
> Take the first street on the left. <br/>
> How was your first day at work? <br/>
> Their second album wasn't as good as the first. <br/>
> John's first mistake was that he went alone. <br/>
> 🔴 My the first day at work was terrible. <br/>
> 🔴 That was John's the first mistake. <br/>

In the names of the king or queen, we use the ordinal numeral at the end.

> John I ➡ John the First <br/>
> Henry VIII ➡ Henry the Eighth <br/>

This variant is preferred when there is some kind of order of things we are talking about, for example: **first door on
the right**, ...

### With basic numeral

> noun + basic numeral *(no determiner)* <br/>

There is not a determiner in these phrases. We can use the work **number** before the noun.

> I bought the game on day one. <br/>
> The table of contents is on page two. <br/>
> Many people died in World War II. <br/>
> I choose task number (no.) 12. <br/>
> Please, open page no. 245. <br/>

But with years, we use the definite article.

> in 1982 <br/>
> in **the** year 1982 <br/>

This variant is preferred when we identify something, for example **a room in a hotel**, **a page in a book, ...**

## Multiplicative numerals (multiplicative adverbs)

Basically, there are only three forms of multiplicative numerals.

> once <br/>
> twice <br/>
> **x** times (four times, one hundred and seventy-two times, a million times) <br/>

We can use other numerals as well.

> many times <br/>
> several times 💡několikrát <br/>
> a few times <br/>
> a couple (of) times 💡párkrát <br/>
> countless times 💡nesčíslněkrát <br/>

In questions, we use **How many times ...?**

### Expressing a frequency

> multiplicative numeral / adverb + indefinite article + time indication <br/>

> once a day <br/>
> twice a week <br/>
> five times a month <br/>

We can use the preposition **per** in ✏ formal English.

> twice per week <br/>

### Once or one time, twice or two times

Rarely **one times** or **two times** are possible. For example, we can say following.

> once or twice ➡ one or two times <br/>
> twice or three times ➡ two or three times <br/>

We can use **one time** (💡jednou se něco stalo) if we want to say that there was only one occurrence.

> I remember one time I was driving from work and I hit a deer! <br/>
> One time I was invited to speak at a conference in Madrid. <br/>

**Once** has a meaning 💡kdysi too (indefinite time in the past).

> I once lived here. <br/>
> He was famous once, but now no one cares. <br/>

**Once** can be a conjunction too (💡až, když).

> I will give you your gift once you give me mine. <br/>

### Comparison

Dvakrát více, pětkrát rychleji
Při porovnávání často používáme spojení s AS:

twice as much/many – dvakrát více
three times as fast – třikrát rychleji/rychlejší
ten times as heavy – desetkrát těžší

Od tří výše se používá i THREE TIMES FASTER, FOUR TIMES LONGER apod.

### Twofold, threefold, tenfold, etc.

> twofold 💡dvakrát, dvojnásobně, dvojnásobný <br/>
> threefold 💡třikrát, trojnásobně, trojnásobný <br/>
> fourfold 💡čtyřikrát <br/>
> fivefold 💡pětkrát <br/>
> sixfold 💡šestkrát <br/>
> tenfold 💡desetkrát <br/>

We use these words primarily when we talk about an increase, a grew, a drop, etc.

> Their income has increased sixfold over the last five years. <br/>
> The population grew almost twofold. <br/>

These words can be used as an adjective too.

> We expect a threefold increase in traffic in the town center. <br/>
