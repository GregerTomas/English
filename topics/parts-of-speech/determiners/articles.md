## Countable singular nouns without a determiner

Phrases with a preposition. A noun is not considered as a physical thing but as a activity.

### School

For example, **I was at school.** does not always mean that I am in the building, I can be in the garden as well or at
lunch.

> The school burned down in 1994. <br/>
> She worked at a school in the south of England for a few years. <br/>
> All the classrooms in the school are equipped with computers. <br/>
> Can't talk right now. I'm at school. <br/>
> We don't go to school on weekends. <br/>

The same rules apply to other words like **college**, **university**, **high school**.

> She's going to university next year. <br/>
> Grow up! You're in college now. <br/>
> My son graduated from high school last month. <br/>

### Home / work

At school, to school, at home, ...

> My mom's still at work. I'll tell her you stopped by. <br/>
> I'm sick. I'm not going to work today. <br/>
> I can't find my phone. I must have left it at home. <br/>

We do not use **home** with preposition **to**. Sometimes we do not use a preposition at all.

> ðŸ”´ I'm going to home. âž¡ ðŸŸ¢ I'm going home.
> ðŸ”´ Honey, I'm at home! âž¡ ðŸŸ¢ Honey, I'm home!

We can not use **at home** / **at work** if we want to say that we are at a somebody's house.

> I stopped by my dad's office on my way to school this morning. <br/>
> She spent the night in her friend's house. <br/>
> Your parents are out of town, right? Let's go to your place! <br/>

### Car / bike / ...

We do not use an article with these nouns if used with preposition **by**. We talk about a type of transport.

> It's about 15 minutes by car. <br/>
> It might be faster by bike than by bus. <br/>
> The island can be reached by plane or by ferry. <br/>
> by air / by road / by rail / by sea / by land <br/>

If we think one particular vehicle, we must use a determiner.

> I came by bus. âž¡ I came on the 7:30 bus. <br/>
> The robber escaped by bike. âž¡ The robber escaped on a stolen bike. <br/>
> We're going to the beach by car. âž¡ We're going to the beach in my father's car. <br/>

But if we talk about places, we use standard articles.

> There are fifty cells in the prison. <br/>
> The floor in the church was cold. <br/>

There is no general rule, see the following.

> ðŸ”´ He won't answer the phone. He's in gym. âž¡ ðŸŸ¢ He won't answer the phone. He's in the gym.
> ðŸ”´ He and his friends go to pub every Saturday night. âž¡ ðŸŸ¢ He and his friends go to the pub every Saturday night.
