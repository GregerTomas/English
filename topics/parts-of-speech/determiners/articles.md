## Definite article

It expresses a specific thing. Both speaker and listener should have in mind the same thing.

> Where's the kitchen? It's the door on your right *(the specific door on you right)*.

There are two variants of **the** which differ only in pronunciation.

* the /'ðə/ (čteme krátce s /ə/) 💡*před vyslovovanou souhláskou*
* the /ði:/ (čteme dlouze s /i:/) 💡*před vyslovovanou samohláskou*

### Known thing

We use the definite article before a noun if a listener knows the noun.

> He lives in a house in the city centre and the house is very old. <br/>
> The car which I bought yesterday is excellent. *(the listener must know about the car)* <br/>

### Only one instance

in the world, in a state, in a house

> The sun is shining. <br/>
> Can you put it in the fridge? <br/>
> I think I left it in the car. <br/>
> Where's John? – He's in the bathroom. <br/>

### Oceans, seas, rivers, canals

> **oceans, seas** - the Pacific, the Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, the Mediterranean <br/>
> **rivers** - the Mississippi, the River Elbe, the Missouri River <br/>
> **straits, canals, bays** - the Bering Strait, the Gulf of Mexico, the Panama Canal, the English Channel <br/>

But we use the negative article for **lakes**.

### Mountains, groups of islands, deserts

> **mountains** - the Alps, the Himalayas, the Sierra Nevada, the Andes <br/>
> **groups of islands** - the Shetlands, the Channel Islands, the British Isles <br/>
> **deserts** - the Sahara, the Great Sandy Desert, the Mojave Desert <br/>

### States (definite article)

We use the definite article for states which:

* names consist of multiple words and include a common noun,
* are in plural.

> the Czech Republic <br/>
> the United States of America <br/>
> the United Kingdom <br/>
> the European Union <br/>
> the Netherlands <br/>

Phrases like **the state of**, **the republic of**, ...

> New Mexico, New Zealand, Great Britain <br/>

### Buildings (definite article)

If a name of a building starts with a noun or an adjective, we use the definite article.

> the World Trade Center <br/>
> The National Museum <br/>
> the White House <br/>
> the Empire State Building <br/>
> The Statue of Liberty <br/>

But there are some exceptions.

> Big Ben <br/>

### Hotels, theatres, cinemas, museums

> **hotels** - the Ritz, the Grand Hotel <br/>
> **theatres, cinemas** - the Odeon, the Apollo Theatre <br/>
> **museums** - the Acropolis Museum, the Prado, the Riverside Museum, the Museum of London, the Tate Gallery <br/>

### Families

> The Simpsons live in Springfield. <br/>
> I met the Browns this morning. <br/>

### Profession, function before name

> "Her writing is terrible," the writer Stephen King said in an interview. <br/>
> We were able to finish the project with the help of the teacher John Barnes. <br/>

### Name with adjective

> He had a chat with the famous Jared Leto. <br/>

> She held the dying John Smith in her arms. <br/>
> The book was dedicated to the late Peter Sellers. <br/>
> The Amazing Spiderman. <br/>

Sometimes an adjective is inseparable from a name.

> Gandalf the Grey <br/>
> William the Conqueror <br/>
> Ivan the Terrible <br/>
> Henry the Eighth <br/>

### That one

* **the** - that one
* **a / an** - someone else with the same name

> He had lunch with Dan Brown. What, the Dan Brown? <br/>
> No, not the Dan Brown who wrote the Da Vinci Code. A different Dan Brown. <br/>

## Indefinite article

It does not express a specific thing. An instance of a noun does not matter.

> Where's the kitchen? It's a door on your right. *(any door on the right side)*

**a** 💡*před vyslovovanou souhláskou*
> a dog, a house, a union

**an** 💡*před vyslovovanou samohláskou*

> half an hour <br/>
> twice a week <br/>

plural / uncountable noun, we use **some**.

> some cars, some snow, some money

> Romeo was a Montague, Juliet was a Capulet. <br/>

> He's not a Mozart, but he sure can play the piano. <br/>

### Name as object replacement

> He owns a Picasso. 💡Picasso = a painting by Picasso <br/>

The same rules apply as when using a whole phrase.

> Does he still own the Picasso? <br/>
> He owns two Picassos now. <br/>
> Has the new Avril Lavigne come out yet? <br/>
> My favorite Vonnegut is Slaughterhouse-Five. <br/>

But some use the definite article.

#### Be in a mood

We can use adjective with this phrase as follows.
> Be in a good mood. 💡*Mít dobrou náladu.* <br/>

If we omit the adjective, the meaning is negative.
> Be in a mood. 💡*Mít špatnout náladu.* <br/>

The phrase **be in one of his / her moods** is also negative.

> My mother is in one of her moods again. <br/>

We do not use this phrase in a negative sentences

#### Be in the mood

It must be clear from context that we have / do not have a mood for something particular.

> Do you want to go swimming? No, I'm not in the mood. <br/>
> I didn't want to talk about it. I wasn't in the mood. <br/>

> 🔴 in next / last week ➡ 🟢 next / last week <br/>

sentence.

> I worked really hard last week. <br/>
> He changed a lot last year. <br/>
> The number of visitors suddenly increased last month. <br/>

#### Summary

| phrase                      | 💡translation         |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| last year                   | loni                  |
| a year ago                  | před rokem            |
| the last year               | posledních 365 dní    |
| next year                   | příští rok            |
| in a year / a year from now | za rok                |
| the next year               | následujících 365 dní |

### Ago / in / from now

#### Ago

Do not forget to use an article with nouns like day, week, month, ...
> a week ago <br/>
> an year ago <br/>

#### Ago vs before

**Before** refers to some event, unlike **ago** which is counted from now.

> I bought the presents a week ago. <br/>
> Christmas was wonderful. I bought the presents a week before. <br/>

### In / from now

We can use **in** / **from now** if we want to say that something will happen after some time.

> Our vacation ends in a week. <br/>
> Come back in a year and we'll see. <br/>
> Our vacation ends a week from now. <br/>
> Come back a year from now and we'll see. <br/>

## Countable singular nouns without a determiner

Phrases with a preposition. A noun is not considered as a physical thing but as a activity.

### School

For example, **I was at school.** does not always mean that I am in the building, I can be in the garden as well or at
lunch.

> The school burned down in 1994. <br/>
> She worked at a school in the south of England for a few years. <br/>
> All the classrooms in the school are equipped with computers. <br/>
> Can't talk right now. I'm at school. <br/>
> We don't go to school on weekends. <br/>

The same rules apply to other words like **college**, **university**, **high school**.

> She's going to university next year. <br/>
> Grow up! You're in college now. <br/>
> My son graduated from high school last month. <br/>

### Home / work

At school, to school, at home, ...

> My mom's still at work. I'll tell her you stopped by. <br/>
> I'm sick. I'm not going to work today. <br/>
> I can't find my phone. I must have left it at home. <br/>

We do not use **home** with preposition **to**. Sometimes we do not use a preposition at all.

> 🔴 I'm going to home. ➡ 🟢 I'm going home.
> 🔴 Honey, I'm at home! ➡ 🟢 Honey, I'm home!

We can not use **at home** / **at work** if we want to say that we are at a somebody's house.

> I stopped by my dad's office on my way to school this morning. <br/>
> She spent the night in her friend's house. <br/>
> Your parents are out of town, right? Let's go to your place! <br/>

### Car, bike, etc.

We do not use an article with these nouns if used with preposition **by**. We talk about a type of transport.

> It's about 15 minutes by car. <br/>
> It might be faster by bike than by bus. <br/>
> The island can be reached by plane or by ferry. <br/>
> by air / by road / by rail / by sea / by land <br/>

If we think one particular vehicle, we must use a determiner.

> I came by bus. ➡ I came on the 7:30 bus. <br/>
> The robber escaped by bike. ➡ The robber escaped on a stolen bike. <br/>
> We're going to the beach by car. ➡ We're going to the beach in my father's car. <br/>

### Other nouns

| noun          |                                       |                                  |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| bed           | in bed *(he has gone to sleep)*       | to bed *(go to sleep)*           |
| prison / jail | in prison / jail                      | to prison / jail                 |   
| church        | in church                             | to church                        | 
| hospital      | in hospital *(be there as a patient)* | to hospital *(go for treatment)* | 
| foot          | on foot                               |                                  |
| hand          | by hand                               |                                  |
| person        | in person                             |                                  |

But if we talk about places, we use standard articles.

> There are fifty cells in the prison. <br/>
> The floor in the church was cold. <br/>

There is no general rule, see the following.

> 🔴 He won't answer the phone. He's in gym. ➡ 🟢 He won't answer the phone. He's in the gym.
> 🔴 He and his friends go to pub every Saturday night. ➡ 🟢 He and his friends go to the pub every Saturday night.
