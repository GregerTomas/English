# Determiners - basic information

They determine a noun.

## Determines + adjectives

A noun can be enriched with multiple determiners and adjectives.

> **determiners** + **adjectives** + **noun** <br/>

> a blue car <br/>
> my older brother <br/>
> another wrong answer <br/>
> the two big blue cars <br/>
> all the lonely people <br/>

## Specific determiners

### Articles

There three types: definite, indefinite and zero, see also [Articles article](articles.md).

### Possessive "pronouns"

> my, your, his, her, its, our, their <br/>

In fact, these words are determiners, not pronouns.

> mine, yours, his, hers, its, ours, theirs

These words are true possessive pronouns, not determiners.

### Demonstrative "pronouns"

ðŸ’¡ ukazovacÃ­ zÃ¡jmena

> this, that, these, those <br/>

They can be pronouns if they stay alone, or determiners if they stay before a noun.

> Give me **that**. <br/>
> I like **these**. <br/>
> **This** is mine. <br/>

> Give me **that book**. <br/>
> I like **these shoes**. <br/>
> **This car** is mine. <br/>

### Possessive nouns

We consider the whole possessive phrase as a single determiner.

> **my parents'** house <br/>
> **the world's largest** encyclopaedia ðŸ’¡***The** je vztaÅ¾eno k **world**, ne k **encyclopaedia***<br/>

### Summary

We cannot combine determiners from the previous groups.

> ðŸ”´ **~~these my~~** students âž¡ ðŸŸ¢ **these** students of **mine** <br/>
> ðŸ”´ **~~my the~~** best friend <br/>
> ðŸ”´ **~~this Peter's~~** car <br/>
> ðŸ”´ **~~the my mother's~~** bike <br/>

## General (quantitative) determiners

### Pre-determiners - all, both, half, ...

They are used before a specific determiner. We can use the preposition **of** between them.

> **all the** world <br/>
> **all my** money <br/>
> **both my** parents <br/>
> **half the** time <br/>
> **twice the** size <br/>
> **all (of) these** people <br/>
> **both (of) my** parents <br/>

We can use them together with the preposition **of** and a pronoun.

> **all of** it <br/>
> **all of** them <br/>
> **both of** them <br/>
> **half of** those <br/>

### Post-determiners - ordinal numerals

> first, second, next, last, other, ... <br/>

> **the first** man on the moon <br/>
> **the next** week <br/>
> **the last** warning <br/>
> **the other** side <br/>
> all **the other** people <br/>

### Basic numerals and quantifiers

> one, two, some, any, many, few, a few, every, either, neither, each, no, ... <br/>

> **one** man <br/>
> **several** cars <br/>
> **some** people <br/>
> **a little** time <br/>
> **no** problem <br/>

## Combination determiners

We can combine determiners from previous groups, sometimes we must use the preposition **of**.

> **the first two** people on Earth <br/>
> **the last few** surviving members <br/>
> **some of my** friends <br/>
> **one of the** children <br/>
> **each of the** following links <br/>
> **any of these** numbers <br/>
> **none of the** candidates <br/>

> no ðŸ†š none <br/>

**order of determiners and adjectives**

> both my brothers <br/>
> my two brothers <br/>
> all the world <br/>
> the whole world <br/>

**determiners in question, negative or positive sentences**

> some ðŸ†š any <br/>
> no <br/>
> much <br/>
> little ðŸ†š a little <br/>

**determiners with un/countable nous**

> little ðŸ†š few <br/>
> much ðŸ†š many <br/>

**determiners with singular/plural nouns**
