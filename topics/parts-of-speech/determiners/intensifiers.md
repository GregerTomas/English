# Intensifiers

- [So](#so)
- [Such](#such)

## So

Used for emphasizing an **adverb** or an **adjective**.

> I'm not going to give up so easily. <br/>
> Thank you so much! <br/>
> He spoke so quickly that I couldn't understand what he was saying. <br/>
> Oh, thank you. You're so kind. <br/>
> The view was so beautiful. <br/>
> I'm not so hungry anymore. <br/>

We can use it with **much**, **many**, **few**, **little** as well.

> There's so much to do and so little time to do it. <br/>
> Why do you have so many keys? <br/>

We can not use it if there is a noun after the adjective.

> ðŸ”´ He's a so kind person. <br/>
> ðŸ”´ It was a so beautiful view. <br/>

## Such

Used for emphasizing a **noun**.

> I don't think it's such a problem. <br/>
> I'm not going to hike in such weather. <br/>
> I can't stand such people. <br/>
> I can't have such a friend. <br/>

There can be an adjective before the noun. We use **such** with a noun, not **so**.

> ðŸ”´ I'm not going out in so bad weather. âž¡ ðŸŸ¢ I'm not going out in such bad weather. <br/>
> ðŸ”´ I can't stand so ignorant people. âž¡ ðŸŸ¢ I can't stand such ignorant people. <br/>
