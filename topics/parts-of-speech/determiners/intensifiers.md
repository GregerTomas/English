## So

Used for emphasizing an **adverb** or an **adjective**.

> I'm not going to give up so easily. <br/>
> Thank you so much! <br/>
> He spoke so quickly that I couldn't understand what he was saying. <br/>
> Oh, thank you. You're so kind. <br/>
> The view was so beautiful. <br/>
> I'm not so hungry anymore. <br/>

We can use it with **much**, **many**, **few**, **little** as well.

> There's so much to do and so little time to do it. <br/>
> Why do you have so many keys? <br/>

We can not use it if there is a noun after the adjective.

> 🔴 He's a so kind person. <br/>
> 🔴 It was a so beautiful view. <br/>

## Such

Used for emphasizing a **noun**.

> I don't think it's such a problem. <br/>
> I'm not going to hike in such weather. <br/>
> I can't stand such people. <br/>
> I can't have such a friend. <br/>

There can be an adjective before the noun. We use **such** with a noun, not **so**.

> 🔴 I'm not going out in so bad weather. ➡ 🟢 I'm not going out in such bad weather. <br/>
> 🔴 I can't stand so ignorant people. ➡ 🟢 I can't stand such ignorant people. <br/>

## Enough

💡dost, v dostatečné míře,

We can use it with **nouns**, **adjectives** or **adverbs**.

### Enough with nouns

We can use **enough** before both countable and uncountable nouns.

> I'd like to buy it but I don't have enough money. <br/>
> He told us to sit down but there weren't enough chairs. <br/>
> The shops were already closed, but luckily we brought enough food with us. <br/>

In this case **enough** has role of a determiner, so we can not use it with another determiner (the, a, your, that, ...)
. But we can use it with the preposition **of**.

> 🔴 I've had enough your excuses. ➡ 🟢 I've had enough of your excuses. <br/>
> 🔴 I can't get enough these cookies. ➡ 🟢 I can't get enough of these cookies. <br/>

It can stand alone as well.

> Stop yelling. That's enough! <br/>
> Another beer? – No, thanks. I've had enough. <br/>
> It's hard to please my parents. Nothing is ever enough for them. <br/>

### Enough with adjectives

We use **enough** after an adjective.

> You can't be a basketball star. You aren't tall enough. <br/>
> The police didn't catch the driver. They weren't fast enough. <br/>
> No matter how hard I try, I always feel that I'm not good enough. <br/>
> Nobody understood him because he wasn't speaking loudly enough. <br/>

### Enough with infinitive

> I don't have enough money to buy a new laptop. <br/>
> The tour was great. We had enough time to see everything we wanted to see. <br/>
> There was enough food to last for a few days. <br/>
> You aren't old enough to drink alcohol. <br/>
> The firefighters came quickly enough to save the house. <br/>
> I had just enough money to buy a hot dog. 💡*Měl jsem jen tak tak peněz na hot dog.* <br/>

Be default, the subject of the infinitive is the same as the subject of the sentence, we can change it with the
preposition **for**.

> There weren't enough chairs for everyone to sit down. <br/>
> They were standing near enough for her to overhear their conversation. <br/>
> My GPA isn't high enough for me to get into a good college. <br/>

## Too

💡příliš

### Too with adjectives or adverbs

> I'm looking for a new place. The rent here is too high. <br/>
> The suitcase was too heavy. I couldn't even lift it. <br/>
> Slow down! You're talking too fast! <br/>
> You're too late. Everybody has left. <br/>

We can amplify **too** with the adverb **way** or weaken it with **a little**.

> I couldn't drive because I was way too tired. 💡*až příliš* <br/>
> Five bucks is a little too much, don't you think? 💡*trošičku moc*<br/>

### Too with nouns

We must use phrase with **much**, **many**, **few** or **little**.

> I have too many problems in my life. <br/>
> Don't eat too many sweets! <br/>
> There were too many people, so I stayed outside. <br/>
> Too few know what love really is. <br/>
> Don't eat too much cake or you might be sick. <br/>
> Sometimes too much information is worse than no information at all. <br/>
> Let's move on. We've spent too much time on this already. <br/>
> Here's my credit card, but don't spend too much. <br/>
> There's too much to do and too little time. <br/>

### Too with infinite

> You're never too old to learn. <br/>
> This is too good to be true. <br/>
> I'm too tired to go to the gym today. <br/>
> We were too lazy to do anything, so we stayed in and watched TV all day. <br/>
> I have too many things to cope with right now. <br/>
> It takes too much time to download a movie on my computer. <br/>

As in the case with **enough**, we can change the subject with the preposition **for**.

> The man drove too quickly for us to get his license plate. <br/>
> It was too cold for me to go swimming. <br/>
