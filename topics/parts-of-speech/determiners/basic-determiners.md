## Each other

💡navzájem, vzájemně

> I love you. You love me. We love each other. <br/>
> They visited each other every day. <br/>
> Peter and Steve don't know each other. <br/>
> They hugged each other for a long time. <br/>
> My two best friends hate each other. <br/>

**Each other** is often used after a preposition.

> My parents looked at each other. <br/>
> You must communicate with each other. <br/>
> Why don't you listen to each other? <br/>
> They shouted at each other. <br/>

We can use **each other** for expressing a possession as well.

> They saw the world through each other's eyes. <br/>
> They checked each other's work. <br/>
> We enjoy each other's company. <br/>

**Each other** is substitutable with **one another** which is not that common. We use **one rather** when there are more
than two sides and **each other** when there are exactly two sides, but it is not a rule.

> We saw each other / one another. <br/>
> They never speak to each other / one another. <br/>

## Either / neither

### Expressing agreement or disagreement

We can not use **too** when we agree with a negative sentence (**too** is used with agreement to a positive sentence),
we must use **either**.

There are more possibilities how to express agreement or disagreement, see the following table.

| I like it. <br/>*(positive sentence)* | I do not like it. <br/>*(negative sentence)* | note                                                        |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| I like it too.                        | I do not like it either.                     ||                                                |
| Me too.                               | Me neither.                                  ||                                                |
| So do I.                              | Neither do I.                                | [see also article](#so--neither--verb--subject)             |
|

### So / neither + verb + subject

> I live in Prague. So do I. <br/>
> Jack is a doctor. So is Peter. <br/>
> She is at home. So are her parents. <br/>
> They can sing well. So can Steve. <br/>
> I don't live in Prague. Neither do I. <br/>
> Jack isn't a doctor. Neither is Peter. <br/>
> She isn't at home. Neither are her parents. <br/>
> They can't sing well. Neither can Steve. <br/>

You can use **nor** instead of **neither** in British English.

<hr/>

## Either + or

💡buď ... nebo ...

We talk about two things.

> What are you going to wear? Either a hat or a cap. <br/>
> You will have to buy either the blue T-shirt or the red one. They don't have the yellow one anymore. <br/>
> Either we will go to the cinema, or we will go swimming. We haven't decided. <br/>

**Either** can be used in different places in a sentence.

> Either you can study at home or you can attend a language course. <br/>
> You can either study at home or attend a language course. <br/>
> You can study either at home or at a language school. <br/>

The verb form is determined by the nearer subject.

> Either Jack or Susan is going to come, but not both of them. <br/>
> Either Jack or his parents are going to come. <br/>

### Either 🆚 both

**either** (the first one or the second one) 🆚 **both** (both of them)

Sometimes they can be interchanged, but sometimes the meaning could be changed significantly.

| -Which dress should I wear? <br/>*(same meaning)* | Doctor, should I take these pills or the antibiotics? <br/>*(different meaning)* |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Either dress will look good.                      | Either. You can choose. They are actually the same.                              |
| Both dresses will look good.                      | Both. You need to take these pills together with the antibiotics.                |

We use a singular noun after **either** but a plural noun after **both**.

> There were people standing on either side of the road. <br/>
> There were people standing on both sides of the road. <br/>

### Either way

💡tak či onak / ať je to jak chce

Basically, it is a shortcut of **either this way or that way**. It is often used at the beginning of the sentence and as
a reaction to the previous sentence.

> You can study at home or you can attend a language course. Either way, you will have to work really hard if you want
> to pass the FCE. <br/>
> You can ask someone for help or do it on your own. Either way, I think you will manage just fine. <br/>
> Do you want to go dancing or go to the cinema? Either way, we have to go now. <br/>

<hr/>

## Neither + nor

💡ani ... ani ...

We talk about two things.

> What are you going to wear? – Neither a hat nor a cap. <br/>
> The film was neither interesting nor amusing. <br/>
> We will go neither to the cinema nor to the theatre. <br/>
> 🔴 The film wasn't neither interesting nor amusing. ➡ 🟢 The film was neither interesting nor amusing. <br/>

As with **either + or**, the verb form is determined by the nearer subject.

> Neither Jack nor Susan is going to come. <br/>
> Neither Jack nor his parents are going to come. <br/>

### Inversion

If we use **neither + nor** in classic sentences, we must use the inversion.

> 🔴 You can neither stay here nor you can stay at your grandma's. ➡ 🟢 You can neither stay here nor can you stay at your
> grandma's. *(You can stay neither here nor at your grandma's.)* <br/>

### Neither 🆚 none

If we talk about two things, we use **neither**, if we talk about more than two things, we use **none**.

> I can lend you one of these two books. Which one do you want? Neither of them. I like neither. <br/>
> I can lend you one of these three books. Which one do you want? None of them. I like none. <br/>
> Which one do you want? I have two. Neither. <br/>
> Which one do you want? I have three. None. <br/>

<hr/>

## Both + and

💡jak ... tak ... / i ... i ...

If we use **either + or** or **neither + nor**, we express that we want one thing from two or none of them. If we want
both of them, we use **both + and**.

> What are you going to wear? Both a jumper and a jacket. <br/>
> I am going to tell both Peter and Susan. <br/>
> The film was both interesting and amusing. <br/>

The verb from is always plural.

> Both Jack and Susan are going to come. <br/>

We use *all* for more than two things.
