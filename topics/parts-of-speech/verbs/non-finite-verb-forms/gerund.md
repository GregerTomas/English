# Gerund

It is a form of a verb which stands in a place where a noun is typically used (subject, object, after a preposition). It
is still a verb, so there is no article before it, an object follows immediately without a preposition, etc.

The creation is simple, just add the suffix **-ing** after any verb. It does not have anything common with
continuous tense, so we can create it even for verbs like **see ➡ seeing**, **be ➡ being**, **know ➡ knowing**, etc.

We can create negative gerund with **not** (not going, not seeing) or even passive gerund with **be + past
participle** (being done, being seen).

## Translation

It is a verb that behaves as a noun.

When it is used as a subject or object, it often has a meaning of a noun that describes the verb.

> shopping 💡*nakupování* <br/>
> walking 💡*chození* <br/>
> speaking 💡*mluvení* <br/>
