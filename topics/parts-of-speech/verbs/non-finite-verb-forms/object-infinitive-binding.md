# Object and infinitive

See a following example:
> I want **you to go** there. <br/>
> ðŸ’¡ using **ABY** - Chci, abys tam Å¡el.
> ðŸ’¡ using a object-infinitive binding -

The object in this sentence is **you,** and it is bound with infinitive **to go**.
We can translate these types of sentences with **aby** (*Chci, abys tam Å¡el.*) or as an **object-infinitive binding** (*
Dovolil mu tam jÃ­t.*)
