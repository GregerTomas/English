We use a bare infinitive with verbs like **see**, **hear**, **notice**, **feel**, etc.

> They saw him leave the house. <br/>
> They heard him return late at night. <br/>
> I felt something touch my hand. <br/>

We can use the present participle as well, but then the sentence means that we only heard / saw etc. an activity as it
was in progress.

> I heard somebody start a car. 💡*Slyšel jsem, jak někdo nastartoval auto. (proběhlo to)* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> I heard somebody starting a car. 💡*Slyšel jsem, jak někdo startoval auto. (ale nemusel ho nastartovat, jen se o to
třeba nějakou dobu pokoušel)* <br/>

> I want to see you climb a tree. 💡*Chci tě vidět, jak vylezeš na strom. (chci vidět výsledek, to jak je na
stromě)* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> I want to see you climbing a tree. 💡*Chci vidět, jak lezeš na strom. (nezajímá mě výsledek, zajímá mě pouze ta
činnost, jak se snaží, jak leze – nahoru ale vylézt vůbec nemusí)* <br/>

## Passive voice

We use an infinitive with **to** even for verbs which do not use it in active voice.

> We were forced to come here. <br/>
> He was ordered to shoot anybody who came near. <br/>
> We were told not to laugh. <br/>
> They made me do it. ➡ I was made to do it. <br/>
> They heard him come late at night. ➡ He was heard to come late at night. <br/>
