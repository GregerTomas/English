# Adjective-infinitive binding

## Feelings, emotions

The adjective often expresses feelings or emotions. In Czech, we prefer a subordinate clause, In English we prefer an
infinitive.

> I was happy to see you. <br/>
> I was sad to hear about their break-up. <br/>
> I'm glad to be back! <br/>
> You're lucky to have each other. <br/>
> I'm sorry to hear that. <br/>
> We'll be thrilled to meet you in person. <br/>
> Everyone was shocked to hear the news. <br/>
> I was afraid to go there. <br/>

## Too, enough

> He's too lazy to help me. <br/>
> He's too rich to care about the price of gas. <br/>
> She's too pretty to be single. <br/>
> You're too short to play basketball. <br/>
> It's not too late to say you're sorry. <br/>
> He's too proud to admit he made a mistake. <br/>
> I'm old enough to make my own decisions. <br/>
> I wasn't fast enough to win. <br/>
> He doesn't seem to be healthy enough to play this weekend. <br/>

## It is easy, it is hard

> Is it easy to learn English? <br/>
> It's hard to say "I'm sorry". <br/>
> It was impossible to finish in time. <br/>
> It's important to pay attention. <br/>
> It's pointless to argue with her. <br/>

If we want to use an infinitive as a subject, we should use gerund.

> It's pointless to argue. âž¡ Arguing is pointless. <br/>
> It's easy to learn English. âž¡ Learning English is easy. <br/>

Generally, infinitive bindings do not have a subject. If we want to express an executor of a action, we use the
preposition **for**.

> It's easy to say. âž¡ It's easy for you to say. <br/>
> It's important for you to listen to me. <br/>
> It will be hard for anyone to beat her. <br/>
> It's crucial for us to work together. <br/>
> It's better for them to stay unmarried. <br/>
> Is it easier for girls to get a job? <br/>

In previous examples, we use **it** as a subject. But we can use an object of an infinitive as a subject. Notice that we
do not have to use the passive voice.

> It is easy to read the book. âž¡ The book is easy to read. <br/>
> It was impossible to answer the question. âž¡ The question was impossible to answer. <br/>
> It is hard to find such people. âž¡ Such people are hard to find. <br/>
> It is easy to talk to him. âž¡ He is easy to talk to. <br/>

## It's very kind of you

We describe someone's behavior or actions. We use the preposition **of** (ðŸ”´ not the preposition **from**). The
infinitive can follow as well.

> ðŸ”´ It was very kind from you. âž¡ ðŸŸ¢ It was very kind of you. <br/>
> It's very kind of you. <br/>
> It was thoughtful of him. <br/>
> That was so stupid of you! <br/>
> It was thoughtful of him to see her when she was in the hospital. <br/>
> It was cruel of the writer to leave the readers hanging like that. <br/>
> It's careless of them to leave the door unlocked when they go out. <br/>

## Negative infinitive

Just put **not** before **to**.

> You were lucky not to get hurt. <br/>
> It's important for you not to listen to them. <br/>
> It was kind of you not to mention it. <br/>
