# ✏📚 Participle

💡 přítomné příčestí, přechodníky

Particle is created simply with the **-ing** suffix.

We can replace a subordinate clause (time, relative, purpose / reason) with it, but the subject in both sentences must
be the same. Modal verbs do not have the participle, but verbs like **know**, **be**, etc. do.

> When I came home, I turned the TV on. ➡ 🟢 Coming home, I turned the TV on. <br/>
> When I came home, my mother made me some tea. ➡ 🔴 Coming home, my mother made me some tea. <br/>
> Being really tired, I went to bed. <br/>
> Knowing I would be late, I called my wife. <br/>

## Participle 🆚 gerund

Both the gerund and the participle are a form of a verb, but the gerund has a function of a noun, and, in opposite, the
participle has a function of a verb.

## Usage

### Time subordinate clauses

#### Simultaneously events

Two events took place at the same time (simultaneously). We can choose which clause to replace.

> Just as I sat down, I heard the door bell again. <br/>
> ➡ Sitting down, I heard the door bell again. <br/>
> ➡ I sat down, hearing the door bell again. <br/>

#### One event right after another one

We use the participle for event, which took place earlier.

> When I got up, I had breakfast. ➡ Getting up, I had breakfast. <br/>

#### One event hit another one

Typically continuous tense with simple tense. We use the participle for longer event, e.g. for continuous tense.

> While I was waiting for him at the station, I read the newspaper. ➡ Waiting for him at the station, I read the
> newspaper. <br/>

### Purpose / reason subordinate clauses

Because we were hungry, we stopped at McDonald's. ➡ Being hungry, we stopped at McDonald's. <br/>

### Relative clauses

> The car which is standing in front of the building is mine. ➡ The car standing in front of the building is mine. <br/>

## Negative participle

Just add **not** before the participle.

> Not knowing what to do, I sat down and started crying. <br/>

## Passive participle

**being + suffix -ed**

> Giving me the money, she left. 💡*Když mi dala ty peníze, odešla.* <br/>
> Being given the money, she left. 💡*Když dostala ty peníze, odešla.* <br/>
