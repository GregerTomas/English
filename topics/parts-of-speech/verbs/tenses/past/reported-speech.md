# Reported speech

💡 nepřímá řeč

There is a big difference between Czech and English. Compare following examples.

| Czech                       | Note Czech                                                                                                                                                             | English                                | Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Řekl, že má hlad.**       | Ve vedlejší větě je přítomný čas, který vyjadřuje, že v momentě, kdy on to řekl, to vlastně byla přítomnost (proto přítomný).                                          | **He said (that) he was hungry.**      | Když to řekl, tak měl právě hlad, proto musí být v angličtině oba časy stejné, jeho mluvení i jeho hlad byl v minulosti.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Řekl, že měl hlad.**      | Ve vedlejší větě je použitý minulý čas, který říká, že v momentě, kdy on to řekl, už daný děj (hlad) byl minulostí (proto minulý).                                     | **He said (that) he had been hungry.** | Když to řekl, hlad již tehdy byl minulostí, a proto pokud použijeme pro ‘řekl’ čas minulý, pro ten druhý děj musí být čas, který mluví o tom, co bylo ještě předtím – tedy předminulý čas. Z pohledu přítomnosti (tady a teď) tedy jasně vidíme, jak to bylo: řekl to – v minulosti, měl hlad – ještě předtím |
| **Řekl, že bude mít hlad.** | Ve vedlejší větě je nyní budoucí čas, který znamená, že v moment mluvení dotyčný člověk ještě hlad neměl, ale oznamoval, že v budoucnosti ho mít bude (proto budoucí). | **He said (that) he would be hungry.** | Když to řekl, hlad ještě neměl a očekával hlad v budoucnosti. Would nám vyjádří, že v momentě mluvení to byla budoucnost, nemusí to však být budoucnost z našeho pohledu (tady a teď), ten hlad již nyní pravděpodobně nemá                                                                                   |

In practice, what actually happens is that what is in direct speech is simply moved **one tense back**.

## When we do not change things?

### Information is truth

We do not have to do changes if any information is still true.

> He said that he went there yesterday. 💡*Řekl, že tam včera jel (včera z pohledu dneška, tedy dne, kdy tuto větu říkáme
my)*. <br/>
> He said that he had gone there the day before. 💡*Řekl, že tam jel den předtím (než to řekl).* <br/>

> He said that he will help me. 💡*Řekl, že mi pomůže, t.j. stále čekám pomoc (furt je to budoucnost).* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> He said that he would help me. 💡*Řekl, že mi pomůže (a pomohl / ale nepomohl). Pomoc už nečekám.* <br/>

### Main clause in present tense

We do not use the tense movement, if the main clause is in the present tense.

> He says that ... <br/>
