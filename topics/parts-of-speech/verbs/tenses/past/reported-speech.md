# Reported speech

💡 nepřímá řeč

There is a big difference between Czech and English. Compare following examples.

| Czech                       | Note Czech                                                                                                                                                             | English                                | Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Řekl, že má hlad.**       | Ve vedlejší větě je přítomný čas, který vyjadřuje, že v momentě, kdy on to řekl, to vlastně byla přítomnost (proto přítomný).                                          | **He said (that) he was hungry.**      | Když to řekl, tak měl právě hlad, proto musí být v angličtině oba časy stejné, jeho mluvení i jeho hlad byl v minulosti.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Řekl, že měl hlad.**      | Ve vedlejší větě je použitý minulý čas, který říká, že v momentě, kdy on to řekl, už daný děj (hlad) byl minulostí (proto minulý).                                     | **He said (that) he had been hungry.** | Když to řekl, hlad již tehdy byl minulostí, a proto pokud použijeme pro ‘řekl’ čas minulý, pro ten druhý děj musí být čas, který mluví o tom, co bylo ještě předtím – tedy předminulý čas. Z pohledu přítomnosti (tady a teď) tedy jasně vidíme, jak to bylo: řekl to – v minulosti, měl hlad – ještě předtím |
| **Řekl, že bude mít hlad.** | Ve vedlejší větě je nyní budoucí čas, který znamená, že v moment mluvení dotyčný člověk ještě hlad neměl, ale oznamoval, že v budoucnosti ho mít bude (proto budoucí). | **He said (that) he would be hungry.** | Když to řekl, hlad ještě neměl a očekával hlad v budoucnosti. Would nám vyjádří, že v momentě mluvení to byla budoucnost, nemusí to však být budoucnost z našeho pohledu (tady a teď), ten hlad již nyní pravděpodobně nemá                                                                                   |

In practice, what actually happens is that what is in direct speech is simply moved **one tense back**.

### Verbs

> come ➡ go 💡***Come** znamená přijít **sem**, **sem** se ale změnilo.* <br/>
> bring ➡ take 💡***Bring** znamená přinést **sem**, **sem** se ale změnilo.* <br/>

## When we do not change things?

### Information is truth

We do not have to do changes if any information is still true.

> He said that he went there yesterday. 💡*Řekl, že tam včera jel (včera z pohledu dneška, tedy dne, kdy tuto větu říkáme
my)*. <br/>
> He said that he had gone there the day before. 💡*Řekl, že tam jel den předtím (než to řekl).* <br/>

> He said that he will help me. 💡*Řekl, že mi pomůže, t.j. stále čekám pomoc (furt je to budoucnost).* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> He said that he would help me. 💡*Řekl, že mi pomůže (a pomohl / ale nepomohl). Pomoc už nečekám.* <br/>

### Main clause in present tense

We do not use the tense movement, if the main clause is in the present tense.

> He says that ... <br/>

## Questions

We must change the word order, because the question is not question anymore, it is a simple announcement sentence. We
must also use verbs like **asked**, **wanted to know**, **wondered**, **enquired** instead of **said**.

> He asked if ... <br/>
> He asked where/when/how/... ... <br/>


> "Are you happy?" ➡ He asked if I was happy. <br/>
> "Do you like me?" ➡ He asked if I liked him. <br/>
> "Will you help me?" ➡ He asked me if I would help him. <br/>
> "What's your name?" ➡ He asked what my name was. <br/>
> "Where do you work?" ➡ He asked where I worked. <br/>
> "What is she doing?" ➡ He asked what she was doing. <br/>
> "What's your name?" ➡ He wondered what my name was. <br/>

## Imperative

We must use
the [object + infinitive binding](/topics/parts-of-speech/verbs/non-finite-verb-forms/object-infinitive-binding.md), so
we do not care about the tense movement.

We use verbs like **tell**, **ask** (in this context: 💡*poprosit, požádat*), **order**, **command**, etc.

### Order

> "Come again." ➡ He told me to come again. <br/>
> "Stand up!" ➡ He ordered me to stand up. <br/>
> "Be back by midnight." ➡ He told me to be back by midnight. <br/>

### Plea, request

> "Help me, please." ➡ He asked me to help him. <br/>
> "Do me a favour, please." ➡ He asked her to do him a favour. <br/>

### Negative order

> "Don't do it!" ➡ He told me not to do it. <br/>
> "Don't say that again, please." ➡ He asked me not to say that again. <br/>

## Short answers

In direct speech, we can use yes, no, tomorrow as an answer. But in the reported speech, we must create a whole
sentence.

> "Are you happy?" ➡ I asked if he was happy. <br/>
> "Yes." (Yes, I am.) ➡ He said that he was. <br/>

> "Do you like the film?" ➡ I asked if he liked the film. <br/>
> "Yes." (Yes, I do.) ➡ He answered that he did. <br/>

> "Will she come back?" ➡ I asked if she would come back. <br/>
> "Yes." (Yes, she will.) ➡ He replied that she would. <br/>

> "Have you ever been there?" ➡ I asked if he had ever been there. <br/>
> "No." (No, I haven't.) ➡ He answered that he hadn't. <br/>

## Reporting verbs

We say sentences in purpose (criticizing, commending, threatening, etc.). If we transform the direct speech to the
reported speech, we should use a proper reported verb.

> He **said** I was irresponsible. 🆚 He **criticized** me for being irresponsible. <br/>
> "Eh, I was wondering if… if you would like to go for a coffee with me?" 🆚 He shyly invited her for a coffee ... <br/>
> "Oh, that would really be wonderful!"    🆚 ... and she gladly accepted his invitation. <br/>

### Verb + subordinate clause

We use an object subordinate clause with conjunction **that** (we can omit it), **if** or **interrogative pronoun**
after these verbs

> He **said** (that) he was hungry. 💡*Řekl, že ...* <br/>
> He **explained** (that) he didn't have much time. 💡*Vysvětlil, že ...* <br/>
> He **claimed** (that) the bag was his. 💡*Tvrdil, že ...* <br/>
> He **agreed** (that) it was a good idea. 💡*Souhlasil, že ...* <br/>
> He **decided** (that) they would spend their holiday in Greece. 💡*Rozhodl se, že ...* <br/>
> He **hoped** (that) she would arrive in time. 💡*Doufal, že ...* <br/>
> He **promised** (that) they would visit them again. 💡*Slíbil, že ...* <br/>
> She **threatened** (that) she would call the police. 💡*Vyhrožovala, že ...* <br/>
> He **warned** (that) something bad could happen. 💡*Varoval, že ...* <br/>
> She **asked** if he had enough time. 💡*Zeptala se, jestli ...* <br/>
> He **replied** (that) he did. 💡*Odpověděl, že ...* <br/>
> She **answered** (that) she would be happy to visit him. 💡*Odpověděla, že ...* <br/>
> He **offered** (that) he would lend it to me. 💡*Nabídl, že ...* <br/>
> He **suggested** (that) they go to the cinema. 💡*Navrhl, že ...* <br/>

❗There is not tense movement in a subordinate clause after the verb **suggest**.

### Verb + indirect object + subordinate clause

> He **told me** (that) he was tired. 💡*Řekl mi, že ...* <br/>
> He **promised her** (that) he would never stop loving her. 💡*Slíbil jí, že ...* <br/>
> He **warned us** (that) he would call the police. 💡*Varoval nás, že ...* <br/>
> She **asked him** if he could help her. 💡*Zeptala se ho, jestli ...* <br/>
> He **offered them** (that) he would take them home. 💡*Nabídl jim, že ...* <br/>
> They **advised us** (that) we shouldn't buy it. 💡*Poradili nám, že ...* <br/>

### Verb + infinitive

If both main and subordinate clause have the same subject, we can use **verb + infinitive** after some specific verbs.

> He promised to return the book. 💡*Slíbil, že vrátí ...* <br/>
> He offered to take her home. 💡*Nabídl, že jí sveze ...* <br/>
> He claimed to be a professional. 💡*Tvrdil, že je ...* <br/>
> He agreed to bring the book to school. 💡*Souhlasil s tím, že vezme ...* <br/>
> He threatened to kill her. 💡*Hrozil, že ...* <br/>
> He decided to stay at home. 💡*Rozhodl se, že zůstane ...* <br/>
> He hoped to be there on time. 💡*Doufal, že tam bude ...* <br/>
> He refused to do it. 💡*Odmítl to udělat ...* <br/>

For some verbs, it is not possible.

> 🔴 He suggested to go out. ➡ 🟢 He suggested going out. <br/>

### Verb + indirect object + infinitive

> He promised her to marry her. 💡*Slíbil jí, že si ji vezme.* <br/>
> He told me to stop. 💡*Řekl mi, abych přestal.* <br/>
> He advised them not to go there. 💡*Poradil jim, aby ...* <br/>
> He encouraged me to go on. 💡*Povzbudil mě, abych ...* <br/>
> She persuaded him to take her home. 💡*Přesvědčila ho, aby ...* <br/>
> They reminded me to hand in the essay. 💡*Připomněli mi, abych ...* <br/>
> He wanted me to go to his party. 💡*Chtěl, abych šel ...* <br/>
> We asked them to visit us. 💡*Požádali jsme je, aby ...* <br/>

### Verb + direct object

> He accepted the offer. 💡*Přijal nabídku.* <br/>
> He refused their help. 💡*Odmítl jejich pomoc.* <br/>

### Verb + direct object + direct object

> He offered me some tea. 💡*Nabídl mi čaj.* <br/>
> She told me the truth. 💡*Řekla mi pravdu.* <br/>
> He asked them a question. 💡*Zeptal se jich na jednu otázku.* <br/>
