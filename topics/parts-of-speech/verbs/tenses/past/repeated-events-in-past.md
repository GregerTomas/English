# Repeated events in the past

## Used to

See [this article](used-to.md).

## Would

> He **would always bring** her flowers on her birthday. 💡*Vždycky jí k narozeninám nosíval kytky.* <br/>
> When they were still married, they **would go** out almost every night. <br/>
> My grandparents **would sometimes take** us on vacation with them. <br/>
> At Christmas in the past, people **would light** candles on trees to welcome guests. <br/>

## Used to 🆚 would

They are often equivalent, but not always.

### Impossible would

We cannot use **would** if we talk about states, so we can use it only for repeated activities. For states, we can
use **used to**.

> My parents **would** always stand in front of the school and wait for me. 💡*Opakovaná činnost, stáli tam jeden den,
potom
další den znovu, a potom znovu* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> 🔴 A tree **~~would~~** stand in front of the school. ➡ 🟢 A tree **used to** stand in front of our school. 💡*Ten strom
stával před
školou pořád, ne opakovaně.* <br/>

> Look how tall Jack is now. He **used to be very short** as a kid. <br/>
> We **used to have relatives** in Connecticut. <br/>
> My grandmother **used to believe in God**. <br/>
> She **used to live** in a little village. <br/>

We don't use it even if it is an activity that a person does repeatedly, but we are not so much concerned with the
repetition, but with the fact that it is characteristic of that person.

> When he was a child, he **used to play** soccer. <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> When he was a child, he **would often play** soccer with his friends in the yard. <br/>

> He **used to smoke**. <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> He **would smoke** cigarettes in the barn. <br/>

### Impossible used to

We cannot use it for a sequence of actions.

> 💡*Vždycky se vrátil domů, pak zazvonil telefon, on ho zvedl a pak na několik hodin zmizel.* <br/>

> 🆚 <br/>
