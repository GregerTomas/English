# State 🆚 dynamic verbs

We can use continuous tenses only with dynamic verbs (verbs which describe some activity). On the opposite, state verbs
describe states, opinions, etc. and they cannot take place in a time (they are or are not).

We can distinguish them simply, if you are able to answer with a verb to the question **What are you doing right now?**,
then the verb is probably dynamic.

> 🟢 What are you doing right now? I'm studying. <br/>
> 🔴 What are you doing right now? ~~I have dinner in the fridge.~~ <br/>

## State verbs

> love <br/>
> hate <br/>
> like <br/>
> want <br/>
> need <br/>
> know <br/>
> believe <br/>
> understand <br/>
> prefer <br/>
> remember <br/>
> realize <br/>
> mean <br/>
> suppose <br/>
> belong <br/>
> seem <br/>
> consist <br/>
> depend <br/>
> contain <br/>

❗ Verbs **feel** and **look** could be considered as a state verbs but they can be used in a continuous tense.

> I feel tired. 🆚 I'm feeling tired. 💡*There is not difference in the meaning.* <br/>

## Verbs with multiple meanings

## 🍀 State verbs in continuous tense

There are exceptions when we can use even state verbs in a continuous tense.

### Momentary feeling

> I **love** this song! 💡*Líbí se mi, mám ji rád.* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> **I'm loving** this song! 💡*Ta písnička zní úžasně, teď, co ji slyším, si ji moc užívám, právě teď ji vnímám velmi
pozitivně.* <br/>

> I miss you. 💡*Chybíš mi, stýská se mi.* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> I'm missing you. 💡*Je to intenzivní momentální pocit, právě teď to silně vnímám.* <br/>

> I'm loving it. 💡*McDonald's* <br/>
> **I'm loving** this soup. I could marry this soup! <br/>
> She yelled at him but he looked as if he **was liking** it. <br/>
> He knew he'd hit rock bottom and he **wasn't liking** it at all. <br/>
> When he saw her face, he knew she **was hating** the idea. <br/>

### Something is changing

Very often we use a double comparative in these sentences (**more and more**, **higher and higher**, **less and less**,
etc.).

> I **was liking** it less and less. <br/>
> It seems that more and more people **are hating** the way they look. <br/>
> Fewer and fewer people are believing in God these days. <br/>
