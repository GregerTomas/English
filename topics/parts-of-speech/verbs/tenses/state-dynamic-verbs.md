# State 🆚 dynamic verbs

We can use continuous tenses only with dynamic verbs (verbs which describe some activity). On the opposite, state verbs
describe states, opinions, etc. and they cannot take place in a time (they are or are not).

We can distinguish them simply, if you are able to answer with a verb to the question **What are you doing right now?**,
then the verb is probably dynamic.

> 🟢 What are you doing right now? I'm studying. <br/>
> 🔴 What are you doing right now? ~~I have dinner in the fridge.~~ <br/>

## State verbs

> love <br/>
> hate <br/>
> like <br/>
> want <br/>
> need <br/>

> remember <br/>
> realize <br/>
> mean <br/>
> suppose <br/>

❗ Verbs **feel** and **look** could be considered as a state verbs but they can be used in a continuous tense.
