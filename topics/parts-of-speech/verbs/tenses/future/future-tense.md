# Future tense

## Expressing future

### Will

We use **will** in following cases.

#### Momentary decision

💡 pro co jsem se právě rozhodl

> I'm busy right now. I'll call you later. <br/>
> Don't go! Okay, I'll stay a bit longer. <br/>
> Which one do you want? I'll take the blue one. <br/>
> Can you lend me some money? Okay, I'll lend you 20 dollars. <br/>

#### Prediction/forecast of the future

💡 co si myslím, že se stane

The prediction is based on no already obvious facts.

> I don't think it'll rain tomorrow. <br/>
> He'll probably change his mind. <br/>
> I think he'll be late again. <br/>
> In 2100, cars will fly. <br/>

#### Promises, orders, pleas, warnings, threats

> I'll have a beer. 💡*objednávka* <br/>
> You'll get hurt, be careful! 💡*varování* <br/>
> I'll kill you if you touch her again. 💡*výhrůžka* <br/>
> I'll help you with the homework. 💡*slib* <br/>
> I'll help you if you want. 💡*nabídka* <br/>
> Will you do that for me? 💡*prosba* <br/>

### Be going to

The informal variant of these phrase is **gonna**.

> I'm gonna be there. <br/>
> They're gonna miss the bus. <br/>

For verbs **go** and **come** we can use even the present continuous tense.

> I'm going to go shopping. 🔃 I'm going shopping. <br/>
> He's going to come tomorrow. 🔃 He's coming tomorrow. <br/>

We use **be going to** in following cases.

#### Announcing our plans

💡 hodlám, plánuju, chci

We have made the decision already.

> I'm going to visit Jack next week. <br/>
> She's going to open her own e-shop. <br/>

#### Prediction based on obvious facts (near future)

💡 schyluje se

> Look! It's going to rain! 💡*vidím např. mraky, schyluje se k dešti, je to vidět* <br/>
> Oh, he's going to be late again! 💡*např. vidím, že už je pozdě teď, nebo že už je tolik a tolik hodin, a on teprve
vstává – z toho usuzuji, že to nestihne* <br/>

### Present continuous

It is used for arrangements (💡*pevně naplánované, zařízené nebo zajištěné děje*) which we take as a fact.

> **She's leaving** for college next week and won't be back until Thanksgiving. 💡*Nemá cenu ji přesvědčovat, začíná jí
škola, má zaplacenou kolej apod.* <br/>
> I can't come with you tomorrow. **I'm helping** my grandma move to a new apartment. 💡*Jsem s babičkou domluvený, ona s
tím počítá.* <br/>
> **I'm starting** a new job tomorrow. Do you have any tips for my first day? <br/>
> What time **are you leaving** tonight? <br/>
> **I'm going** to prom with Jules. <br/>
> **I'm not taking** your advice. Not again. <br/>

The determination is a difference between **present continuous** and **be going to**.

> I'm going to drive to town. 💡*Mám to v plánu, ale klidně plán změním, není to nic pevného.* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> I'm driving to town. 💡*Pevně naplánováno, nehodlám to měnit, jsem s někým třeba už domluvený apod. <br/>

> She's going to take Italian next semester. 💡*Má to v plánu, ale může si to rozmyslet. <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> She's taking Italian next semester. 💡*Už je přihlášená, už si to nerozmyslí. <br/>

### Present simple

It is used for events set by a programme, timetable, etc., not for personal plans.

> The bus **leaves** at 10 tomorrow, doesn't it? <br/>
> What time **does** the concert **start**? <br/>
> Registration for the event **opens** on September 22. <br/>
> I'm going to meet her at the station. Her train **gets in** at 6:30. <br/>
> Hurry up. The bus **leaves** in fifteen minutes! <br/>
> **I'm leaving** on Friday. My train **leaves** at 7 AM. 💡*I leave 🆚 the train leaves* <br/>
> We have PE tomorrow instead of IT. <br/>
> We leave on Monday and return on Friday. <br/>

## Present future continuous

It is used for running events in the future. It is not used for **state verbs** (know, like, have, etc.)

> This time next week **I 'll be lying** on the beach. <br/>
> John won't be here at 8. **He'll be taking** his mom to the airport. <br/>
> When the movie ends, **I'll be waiting** for you in front of the theater. <br/>
> Good luck with the interview tomorrow. **I'll be thinking** of you. <br/>
> What **will you be doing** in ten years' time? <br/>
> She **won't be waiting** for you when you get home. <br/>

> He will cook dinner when she comes home. 💡*Až ona přijde, on uvaří, teprve potom začne.* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> He will be cooking dinner when she comes home. 💡*Až ona přijde, on bude právě vařit, bude uprostřed té
činnosti.* <br/>

> **We'll have** dinner at 6 o'clock. 💡*V 6 hodin to začne, navečeříme se.* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> **We'll be having** dinner at 6 o'clock. 💡*V 6 hodin to už bude probíhat, začne to někdy před šestou, skončí to po
šesté*. <br/>

## 🍀 Future perfect

Pretty rare.

> Everyone **will have left** by then. <br/>
> **I'll have finished** the article before tomorrow. <br/>
> **Will you have finished** the report by tomorrow? <br/>
> I **won't have finished** the essay until tomorrow. <br/>

We use it for actions that were finished at some moment in the future (*similarly to present or past perfect*).

> He won't be there. **He'll have gone** home. <br/>
> The meeting **will have finished** by the time we get there. <br/>
> He **will have read** ten books by the end of the year. <br/>
> He hopes scientists** will have found** a cure by the time they unfreeze him. <br/>

We often use time determinations with the preposition **by**, alternatively with **before** or **until**.

> by then <br/>
> by tomorrow <br/>
> by 2050 <br/>
> by the time we arrive <br/>
> My guess is they will have gotten divorced **before the end of the year**. <br/>
> He won't have left the office **until 10**. <br/>

### Future simple 🆚 future perfect

> **I'll be hungry** by the time I get home. 🆚 **It will have been done** by the time I get home. <br/>

> **future simple** ➡ what will happen in the future <br/>
> **future perfect** ➡ what will be done in the future <br/>

The future simple tense usually refers to the time when an event takes place. The future perfect tense does not address
this time, rather it focuses on the time when the action will be completed.

> I'll do it tomorrow. 💡*Děj proběhne zítra.* <br/>
> 🆚
> I'll have done it by tomorrow. 💡*Nevíme, kdy proběhne, říkáme jen, kdy už bude dokončený (možná proběhne dnes, možná
zítra).* <br/>

Sometimes the difference is very small.

> I'll leave before midnight. 💡*Odejdu kdy? – Před půlnocí. Vím, kdy odejdu.* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> I will have left before midnight. 💡*Nevím, kdy odejdu, ale před půlnocí už budu pryč.* <br/>

### Future perfect continuous

> I will have been sleeping. <br/>
> He will have been working. <br/>
> He won't have been reading. <br/>
> Will you have been cooking? 💡*There are hardly any questions.* <br/>

Perfect continuous tenses are often used to say how long something has been going on.

> By the time you get back I **will have been cooking** for two hours. 💡*V tu chvíli (v budoucnosti) to už bude probíhat
dvě
hodiny* <br/>
> This time next year I **will have been teaching** English for ten years. <br/>
> Next week we **will have been living** here for a year. <br/>
> How long **will he have been working** here when he retires? <br/>

For time determination, the preposition **by** is often used.

> **By Christmas** we **will have been going** out for three years. <br/>
> **By September**, I **will have been working** here for five years. <br/>
> **By the time we get there**, I **will have been driving** for hours! <br/>

The passive voice is not used at all, we prefer subordinate clause with the conjunction **that** and **present perfect
continuous tense**.

> 🔴 By January, the new swimming pool ~~will have been being built~~ for three years. <br/>
> Next month it will be three years **that I've been learning** Italian. <br/>
> Come September, it will have been four years **that John has been waiting** for justice. <br/>
> It will soon be a year **that we've been going** out. <br/>

## Shall

### ⏱ Shall 🆚 will

In old English, **shall** was used instead of **will** in the first person singular and plural or for threats and
warnings.

> We **shall** be back on June 2nd. <br/>
> We **shan't** be needing this. <br/>
> You shall pay for this! <br/>
> He shall be sorry. <br/>

We use **would** in the indirect speech.

### Polite questions

💡 mít něco udělat, návrh

> **Shall** I open the window? <br/>
> Which way **shall** I go? <br/>
> What **shall** we do? <br/>
> **Shall** we go out for a drink? <br/>

It can be used as an question tag for the first-person imperative.

> Let's have a drink, **shall we**? <br/>
> Let's go, **shall we**? <br/>

We use **should** in the indirect speech.

> He asked what he should do. <br/>

### Agreements

We can translate it as 💡*muset*.

> Neither party shall disclose any confidential information of the other party to third parties. 💡*Žádná strana
nespokytne třetí straně žádné důvěryhodné informace.* <br/>
> The client shall pay the monthly charge on or before due month. <br/>

## Be + infinitive binding

### ✏ Be supposed to equivalent

💡 orders, commands

> You **were not to leave** the house! 🔃 You **were not supposed to leave** the house. <br/>
> **I'm to stay** home and study tonight. <br/>
> **I'm not to say** a word. <br/>
> He **was to work** on his project but decided to go out instead. <br/>

### ✏ Be going to equivalent

Used for planned events.

> He **is to have** lunch with his boss tomorrow. <br/>
> A Harvard representative **is to visit** us next week. <br/>

### ✏ Destiny

Events that are beyond our control.

> I don't know if **we're to meet** again. <br/>

It is most often used in the past tense, we can say whether something has happened or not.

> She was crying as he got on the train and left. They were to meet again, though. 💡*Plakala, když nasedal do vlaku a
odjel. Ale osud je ještě svedl dohromady.* <br/>
> He didn't know that he was never to see her again. 💡*Nevěděl, že ji již nikdy neuvidí.* <br/>

### Very close future

We use the phrase **be about to**. It is very often used even in 🗣 spoken English. **Be going to** could be used as
well.

> Shut up, **he's about to say** something. <br/>
> Just as I **was about to knock**, the door flew open. <br/>
> **We're just about to eat**, why don't you join us? <br/>
