# Future tense

## Will

We use **will** in following cases.

### Momentary decision

💡 pro co jsem se právě rozhodl

> I'm busy right now. I'll call you later. <br/>
> Don't go! Okay, I'll stay a bit longer. <br/>
> Which one do you want? I'll take the blue one. <br/>
> Can you lend me some money? Okay, I'll lend you 20 dollars. <br/>

### Prediction/forecast of the future

💡 co si myslím, že se stane

The prediction is based on no already obvious facts.

> I don't think it'll rain tomorrow. <br/>
> He'll probably change his mind. <br/>
> I think he'll be late again. <br/>
> In 2100, cars will fly. <br/>

### Promises, orders, pleas, warnings, threats

> I'll have a beer. 💡*objednávka* <br/>
> You'll get hurt, be careful! 💡*varování* <br/>
> I'll kill you if you touch her again. 💡*výhrůžka* <br/>
> I'll help you with the homework. 💡*slib* <br/>
> I'll help you if you want. 💡*nabídka* <br/>
> Will you do that for me? 💡*prosba* <br/>

## Be going to

The informal variant of these phrase is **gonna**.

> I'm gonna be there. <br/>
> They're gonna miss the bus. <br/>

For verbs **go** and **come** we can use even the present continuous tense.

> I'm going to go shopping. 🔃 I'm going shopping. <br/>
> He's going to come tomorrow. 🔃 He's coming tomorrow. <br/>

We use **be going to** in following cases.

### Announcing our plans

💡 hodlám, plánuju, chci

We have made the decision already.

> I'm going to visit Jack next week. <br/>
> She's going to open her own e-shop. <br/>

### Prediction based on obvious facts (near future)

💡 schyluje se

> Look! It's going to rain! 💡*vidím např. mraky, schyluje se k dešti, je to vidět* <br/>
> Oh, he's going to be late again! 💡*např. vidím, že už je pozdě teď, nebo že už je tolik a tolik hodin, a on teprve
vstává – z toho usuzuji, že to nestihne* <br/>

## Present continuous

It is used for arrangements (💡*pevně naplánované, zařízené nebo zajištěné děje*) which we take as a fact.

> She**'s leaving** for college next week and won't be back until Thanksgiving. 💡*Nemá cenu ji přesvědčovat, začíná jí
škola, má zaplacenou kolej apod.* <br/>
> I can't come with you tomorrow. I**'m helping** my grandma move to a new apartment. 💡*Jsem s babičkou domluvený, ona s
tím počítá.* <br/>

> What time **are you leaving** tonight? <br/>

> 🆚 <br/>
> She's taking Italian next semester. 💡*Už je přihlášená, už si to nerozmyslí. <br/>

## Present simple

It is used for events set by a programme, timetable, etc., not for personal plans.

> The bus **leaves** at 10 tomorrow, doesn't it? <br/>
