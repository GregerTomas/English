# Present tense

## Present simple

It is most often used where there is a persistent action or regular activity.

We just move the actions from the past to the present. It is mostly used in jokes or summaries of the plot of the book
or film (for example in a review). The story is then more dramatic, more engaging.

###### Newspaper headlines

Something happened in the past but we use the present tense.

###### Caption of illustrations or photographs

##### Instructions and manuals

We can use either imperative or the present simple.

> **Get off** at the second stop and take the subway. <br/>

> After turning off the power, **you take** a screwdriver and **remove** the top cover. <br/>
> **You get off** at the second stop and then it's a five-minute walk to the hotel. <br/>

## Present continuous

It indicates the events that are taking place at the moment of speaking.

> Are you at work? – No, I'm going home. <br/>
> We're playing Minecraft. Do you want to play with us? <br/>

It may also be something that is not quite literally happening right now, but only at the moment (💡*dočasná činnost,
může probíhat přerušovaně*).

> I'm reading The Great Gatsby. 💡*Nemusím teď nutně sedět nad otevřenou knihou, říkám tím, že ji mám rozečtenou.* <br/>
> He's watching Friends with his wife. 💡*Tato věta sice může znamenat, že teď právě sedí před obrazovkou a sledují
seriál Přátelé, ale také to, že mají ten seriál rozkoukaný, tedy jsou někde uprostřed.* <br/>
> I'm reading a great book. <br/>
> He's going to work by bus this week. <br/>

## Short answers

We cannot use a meaning verb alone.

> 🔴 Does he love you? ➡ 🟢 No, **he doesn't**. <br/>
> Are you working? Yes, **I am**. <br/>

## Present perfect

💡 předpřítomný čas, přítomný čas dokonavý

It is connected with the present, it describes current situation.

Shortcuts, short answers work as usual.

> I **haven't** finished. <br/>
> He **hasn't** gone out. <br/>
> Have you seen Jurassic Park? Yes, **I have**. <br/>
> Has he returned yet? Yes, **he hasn't**. <br/>

### Usage

#### Something has changed

Something has changed and now it is different, now it is changed. So it brings together that something has happened and
that something is now. The emphasis here is on how it is now, not on when it happened, how it happened, why it happened,
etc. We are simply expressing the change.

> **I've bought** a new car. 💡*I have the car now. I do not care when, where, how much did it cost, etc.* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> I **bought** a new car last month. 💡*when* <br/>
> I **bought** it at the new shop in the city center. 💡*where* <br/>
> I **bought** it for £11,000. 💡*how much* <br/>

> **He's quit** his job. 💡*Nyní už tam nepracuje.* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> He **quit** his job yesterday. <br/>
> He **quit** because of his boss. <br/>
> He **quit** before his boss could fire him. <br/>

#### Experience gained so far

💡 něco se již stalo nebo naopak ještě nestalo

> **Did you watch** Forrest Gump last night? Yes, I **did**. <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> **Have you seen** Forrest Gump? Yes, I **have**. <br/>

We often use adverbs **ever**, **never**, **before** (at the end of the sentence), **yet** or **already**.

> Have you **ever** been to Spain? <br/>
> Has your dad **ever** forgotten your birthday? <br/>
> I've **never** ridden a horse. <br/>
> Her boyfriend has **never** cooked for her. <br/>
> I think I've seen this film **before**. <br/>
> I think I know you. Have we met **before**? 💡*Není to poprvé, co ho vidím.* <br/>
> I've **never** had sushi **before**. 💡*Toto je poprvé, ještě nikdy předtím jsem ho neměl.* <br/>

**Yet** is used at the end of the **question** or **negative sentence**. We use it for events which are expected to
happen.

> Have you done your homework yet? 💡*Od dotyčného se očekává, že domácí úkoly udělá. Ptáme se, jestli už se tak
stalo.* <br/>
> Have they fixed the elevator yet? 💡*Čekáme, že by ho teď někdy měli opravit.* <br/>
> I haven't done the dishes yet. 💡*Od dotyčného se to očekává, ale ještě se to nestalo.* <br/>

#### Current "score"

> I had five cups of coffee yesterday. 🆚 **I've had** three cups of coffee today. <br/>

> **I've seen** this movie about twenty times. <br/>
> I have driven a car 3 times in my life. <br/>

#### Summary

The present perfect tense have the connection with present. Do not use it if the actions finished in the past.

> We have to go to lunch, I didn't have breakfast today. <br/>
> I am going to bed, I got up at 5 today. <br/>
> Where did you go on holiday this year? 💡*It is winter right now.*<br/>

### Already, yet, etc.

#### Already

💡 dřív, než se čekalo

We use it in the positive sentences when something has happened sooner than we expected.

> Can you please feed the dog? But I've **already** fed her. <br/>
> What do you want for dinner, pizza or tacos? Nothing, I've **already** eaten. <br/>

Sometimes we can use it event in question, but then it's more of a wonder than a question. We also use the announcing
word order.

> What? They're **already** here? 💡*Člověk se zhrozil, že jeho návštěva už dorazila a on je přitom očekával až
později.* <br/>
> The new R.E.M. album is excellent! What, you've **already** heard it? <br/>

#### Yet

💡 už, ještě ne (něco, co se očekává)

We use it at the end of the questions or negative sentences.

We use it when we are talking about something that is expected of someone, and the sentence then asks whether the person
has already done the expected thing, or the interviewee reports that they have not yet done it.

> Mark, have you taken out the rubbish **yet**? 💡*Rodiče zřejmě očekávají, že Mark bude vynášet odpadky, proto se ptají,
jestli už je vynesl, nebo ne.* <br/>
> Have we paid the phone bill **yet**? 💡*Telefonní účty se mají platit, očekává se, že se budou platit, proto se dotyčný
ptá, jestli už mají ten účet zaplacený.* <br/>
> My parents haven't returned **yet**. <br/>
> I haven't seen the new Harry Potter movie **yet**. 💡*Viděl jsem všechny ostatní díly a očekávám, že shlédnu i ten nový
film, ještě k tomu ale nedošlo.* <br/>
> Have you taken out the rubbish? No, not **yet**. <br/>

**Yet** has also other meanings. One of them is 💡*a přesto, a přitom* to express contrast between two things.

> I told him to go away and **yet** he's still here. <br/>
> Interesting, the room is clean, and yet he was not here. <br/>

#### Still

💡 stále ještě

It is very often used in the negative sentences to express that something has not happened yet. **Still** is used before
a negative auxiliary verb.

> I **still** haven't found what I'm looking for. 💡*Člověk něco nějakou dobu hledá, ale i přesto to ještě
nenašel.* <br/>
> I **still** haven't found the answer. <br/>

We can use it in questions or positive sentences with the present tense.

> The children are **still** at school. 💡*Člověk by čekal, že touto dobou už budou doma, ale nejsou, jsou stále ještě ve
škole.* <br/>
> Are you **still** here? <br/>

Compare it with **always** or **keep telling**.

> He's **always** mad at me. 💡*Stále (pořád, neustále, vždy) se na mě zlobí.* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> He's **still** mad at me. 💡*Stále ještě se na mě zlobí (ještě nepřestal).* <br/>

> He **keeps telling** me what to do. 💡*Pořád mi říká, co mám dělat.* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> He **still** tells me what to do. 💡*Stále ještě mi říká, co mám dělat (dělal to kdysi, a dělá to i nyní, ještě s tím
nepřestal).* <br/>

#### Ever, never

💡 už někdy, ještě nikdy

**Ever** is often used in questions, but can be used even in positive sentences which express how many times we have
done something.

> Have you **ever** seen U2 live? <br/>
> Have you **ever** been to the USA? <br/>
> This is the first time I've **ever** been snowboarding. <br/>

**Never** is used in negative sentences.

> I've **never** heard about him. <br/>
> We've **never** met. <br/>

These adverbs can be used in other tenses as well.

### Examples

#### Have been

💡 odjet, být (a už být zpět)

❗The preposition **to** must be used, the verb describes a movement.

> She **has gone to** Paris. 💡*Odjela do Paříže.* 🆚 She **has been to** Paris twice. 💡*Byla v Paříži dvakrát.* <br/>
> 🔴 She has been **~~in~~** Paris twice. ➡ 🟢 She has been **to** Paris twice. <br/>
