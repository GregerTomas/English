### Usage

#### Something has changed

Something has changed and now it is different, now it is changed. So it brings together that something has happened and
that something is now. The emphasis here is on how it is now, not on when it happened, how it happened, why it happened,
etc. We are simply expressing the change.

> **I've bought** a new car. 💡*I have the car now. I do not care when, where, how much did it cost, etc.* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>

> 🆚 <br/>

We often use adverbs **ever**, **never**, **before** (at the end of the sentence), **yet** or **already**.

> Have you **ever** been to Spain? <br/>

> I've **never** ridden a horse. <br/>
> Her boyfriend has **never** cooked for her. <br/>
> I think I've seen this film **before**. <br/>

> I've **never** had sushi **before**. 💡*Toto je poprvé, ještě nikdy předtím jsem ho neměl.* <br/>

**Yet** is used at the end of the **question** or **negative sentence**. We use it for events which are expected to
happen.

> Have you done your homework yet? 💡*Od dotyčného se očekává, že domácí úkoly udělá. Ptáme se, jestli už se tak
stalo.* <br/>
> Have they fixed the elevator yet? 💡*Čekáme, že by ho teď někdy měli opravit.* <br/>

#### Summary

The present perfect tense have the connection with present. Do not use it if the actions finished in the past.

> We have to go to lunch, I didn't have breakfast today. <br/>
> I am going to bed, I got up at 5 today. <br/>
> Where did you go on holiday this year? 💡*It is winter right now.*<br/>

### Already, yet, etc.

#### Already

💡 dřív, než se čekalo

We use it in the positive sentences when something has happened sooner than we expected.

> Can you please feed the dog? But I've **already** fed her. <br/>
> What do you want for dinner, pizza or tacos? Nothing, I've **already** eaten. <br/>

Sometimes we can use it event in question, but then it's more of a wonder than a question. We also use the announcing
word order.

> What? They're **already** here? 💡*Člověk se zhrozil, že jeho návštěva už dorazila a on je přitom očekával až
později.* <br/>
> The new R.E.M. album is excellent! What, you've **already** heard it? <br/>

#### Yet

💡 už, ještě ne (něco, co se očekává)

We use it at the end of the questions or negative sentences.

We use it when we are talking about something that is expected of someone, and the sentence then asks whether the person
has already done the expected thing, or the interviewee reports that they have not yet done it.

> Mark, have you taken out the rubbish **yet**? 💡*Rodiče zřejmě očekávají, že Mark bude vynášet odpadky, proto se ptají,
jestli už je vynesl, nebo ne.* <br/>
> Have we paid the phone bill **yet**? 💡*Telefonní účty se mají platit, očekává se, že se budou platit, proto se dotyčný
ptá, jestli už mají ten účet zaplacený.* <br/>
> My parents haven't returned **yet**. <br/>
> I haven't seen the new Harry Potter movie **yet**. 💡*Viděl jsem všechny ostatní díly a očekávám, že shlédnu i ten nový
film, ještě k tomu ale nedošlo.* <br/>
> Have you taken out the rubbish? No, not **yet**. <br/>

**Yet** has also other meanings. One of them is 💡*a přesto, a přitom* to express contrast between two things.

> I told him to go away and **yet** he's still here. <br/>
> Interesting, the room is clean, and yet he was not here. <br/>

#### Still

💡 stále ještě

It is very often used in the negative sentences to express that something has not happened yet. **Still** is used before
a negative auxiliary verb.

> I **still** haven't found what I'm looking for. 💡*Člověk něco nějakou dobu hledá, ale i přesto to ještě
nenašel.* <br/>
> I **still** haven't found the answer. <br/>

We can use it in questions or positive sentences with the present tense.

> The children are **still** at school. 💡*Člověk by čekal, že touto dobou už budou doma, ale nejsou, jsou stále ještě ve
škole.* <br/>
> Are you **still** here? <br/>

Compare it with **always** or **keep telling**.

> He's **always** mad at me. 💡*Stále (pořád, neustále, vždy) se na mě zlobí.* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> He's **still** mad at me. 💡*Stále ještě se na mě zlobí (ještě nepřestal).* <br/>

> He **keeps telling** me what to do. 💡*Pořád mi říká, co mám dělat.* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> He **still** tells me what to do. 💡*Stále ještě mi říká, co mám dělat (dělal to kdysi, a dělá to i nyní, ještě s tím
nepřestal).* <br/>

#### Ever, never

💡 už někdy, ještě nikdy

**Ever** is often used in questions, but can be used even in positive sentences which express how many times we have
done something.

> Have you **ever** seen U2 live? <br/>
> Have you **ever** been to the USA? <br/>
> This is the first time I've **ever** been snowboarding. <br/>

**Never** is used in negative sentences.

> I've **never** heard about him. <br/>
> We've **never** met. <br/>

These adverbs can be used in other tenses as well.

### Examples

#### Have been

💡 odjet, být (a už být zpět)

❗The preposition **to** must be used, the verb describes a movement.

> She **has gone to** Paris. 💡*Odjela do Paříže.* 🆚 She **has been to** Paris twice. 💡*Byla v Paříži dvakrát.* <br/>
> 🔴 She has been **~~in~~** Paris twice. ➡ 🟢 She has been **to** Paris twice. <br/>
> Paul's been to the supermarket. <br/>
> Megan has never been to China. <br/>

#### Have gone

💡 odjet (a stále tam být)

It is connected with a place.

> Where has everybody gone? 💡*Kam všichni odešli?* <br/>
> They've gone to the supermarket. 💡*Šli nakoupit.* <br/>
> I've gone to London. 💡*Odjel jsem do Londýna (a ještě tam jsem).* <br/>
> She has gone to bed. <br/>

#### Be gone

💡 být pryč

**Gone** is here a simple adjective.

> He has gone home. 💡*Odešel domů.* <br/>
> I don't know where Steve is. He's gone. <br/>
> The cookies are gone. Have you eaten them? <br/>
> When we arrived, everybody was gone. <br/>

### Present perfect continuous

> **present perfect simple** - puts not on the finished result of the action <br/>
> **present perfect continuous** - puts emphasis on the duration or course of action <br/>

#### Usage

##### How long has something been going on

We use the prepositions **since** (💡*od kdy*) and **for** (💡*jak již dlouho*).

> I have been learning English for three years. 💡*Učím se již tři roky, tedy učení již tři roky probíhá.* <br/>
> How long have you been waiting for me? 💡*Ptám se, jak dlouho už tu čeká, tedy jak dlouho ten děj již probíhá.* <br/>

![Present perfect continuous with for](images/present-perfect-continuous-for.gif)
![Present perfect continuous with since](images/present-perfect-continuous-since.gif)

> 🔴 ~~I am waiting here for two hours.~~ <br/>
> ➡ I **am waiting** here. 💡*Čekám tu. (Pouze říkám, co probíhá právě teď.)* <br/>
> ➡ I **have been waiting** here for an hour. 💡*Čekám tu už hodinu. (Kromě toho, že tu právě teď čekám, říkáme i to, jak
> dlouho již to trvá, tedy ne jen to, co je teď, ale i to, co už bylo.)* <br/>

We can use present perfect simple if the fact had been going on very long, therefore we consider it as a permanent fact.

> I **have been living** here for two years. 💡*Bydlím tu teprve krátkou dobu, sám průběhovým časem vyjadřuji, že se
jedná o kratší dobu.* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> I **have lived** here all my life. 💡*Říkám, že tu bydlím od narození, tedy vždy jsem tu bydlel. Nedáváme důraz na dobu
trvání, ale říkáme spíše to, že to tak bylo vždycky (ne že to teprve nějakou dobu probíhá, prostě to tak je)* <br/>

Sometimes it depends on the point of view of the speaker.
> I **have been living** here for ten years. <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> I **have lived** here for ten years. <br/>

We can omit the preposition **for** in the positive sentences.

> The journey lasts **for** two hours. 🔃 The journey lasts two hours. <br/>

##### What caused the current state

We use it for actions that took place (they are not taking place right now) but we can see their outcomes.

> I'm tired because **I've been working** out. 💡*Posiloval jsem a to vedlo k tomu, že jsem teď unavený (i když už
neposiluji).* <br/>
> Why are you so dirty? **I've been repairing** my car. 💡*Opět říkáme, že jsem špinavý, protože jsem opravoval auto,
tedy to opravování auta vedlo k tomu, že jsem teď špinavý.* <br/>
> It's wet because it's been raining. 💡*Je mokro a vedlo k tomu to, že pršelo (i když už asi neprší). Říkáme však, že
děj (déšť) vedl k současnému výsledku (mokru).* <br/>

![Present perfect continuous](images/present-perfect-continuous.gif)

##### Emphasis on action, not on result

> **He's cooked** dinner. 💡*Uvařil jídlo.* 🆚 He's been cooking dinner. 💡*Uvařil nebo neuvařil jídlo? Kdo ví...* <br/>

> **She's painted** the walls. 🆚 **She's been painting** the walls. <br/>
> **I've repaired** my car. 🆚 I **have been repairing** my car. <br/>
