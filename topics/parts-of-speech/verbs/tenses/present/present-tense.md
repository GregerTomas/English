## Present continuous

It indicates the events that are taking place at the moment of speaking.

> Shhh. Mommy is sleeping. <br/>
> Are you at work? – No, I'm going home. <br/>
> We're playing Minecraft. Do you want to play with us? <br/>

It may also be something that is not quite literally happening right now, but only at the moment.

> I'm reading The Great Gatsby. 💡*Nemusím teď nutně sedět nad otevřenou knihou, říkám tím, že ji mám rozečtenou.* <br/>
> He's watching Friends with his wife. 💡*Tato věta sice může znamenat, že teď právě sedí před obrazovkou a sledují
seriál Přátelé, ale také to, že mají ten seriál rozkoukaný, tedy jsou někde uprostřed.* <br/>
