# Past tense

## Past simple

It is used for events that took place in the past. They could happen once or repeatedly.

> I wanted to buy a new bike. <br/>
> We stayed in a beautiful hotel. <br/>
> Did you see the lovely flowers? <br/>
> Did your parents agree? <br/>
> I didn't know what to do. <br/>
> We didn't sleep well because of the storm. <br/>

## Past continuous

### Usage

#### Something was happening in the past at some point in time

> At five o'clock we were watching TV. <br/>
> When she arrived, we were watching TV. <br/>
> He was having lunch when I called him. <br/>
> I didn't hear you, I was listening to my walkman. <br/>
> He was so funny. He was wearing a pink shirt and orange shorts. <br/>
> This time last year, I was sunbathing on a beach. <br/>

The conjunction **when** can be used before both simple and continuous verbs, but the conjunction **while** can be used
only before a continuous verb.

> When I was watching TV, he arrived. 🔃 I was watching TV when he arrived. <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> He arrived while I was watching TV. 🔃 While I was watching TV, he arrived. <br/>

#### Two independent and simultaneous events

> We **were watching** TV and she **was washing** up the dishes. <br/>

If events are dependent, we must use past simple tense in one of the sentences.

> I **sang** while I **was driving** to work. 💡*Zpíval cestou, pouze v rámci té jízdy autem, nebyly to činnosti, které
by probíhaly nezávisle na sobě.* <br/>

#### Incomplete events

💡 nedokonavé děje (co jsem dělal, ne co jsem udělal)

> Yesterday I wrote my book and then I repaired my bicycle. *Oba dějě dokončil.* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> Yesterday **I was writing** my book and then **I was repairing** my bicycle. 💡*Pravděpodobně nedokončil oba
dějě.* <br/>

#### Where not used
