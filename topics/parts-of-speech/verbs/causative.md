# Causative

💡 dát si něco udělat

We use **have + object + past participle (have sth done)** to say that somebody has done something for us.

> I can fix the car myself. ➡ I have my car fixed. 💡*Nechal jsem si opravit auto.* <br/>
> There was something wrong with my car but I had it fixed. <br/>
> Stay away from me or I'll have you fired. <br/>
> I'm having my kitchen redone. <br/>
> You should have the lawn mowed every once in a while. <br/>
> That's a 1967 Camaro. He had it imported from the States. <br/>
> If you order online, you can either pick it up yourself or have it delivered. <br/>
> I have fixed my car. 💡*present perfect* 🆚 I have my car fixed. 💡*causative* <br/>

Wee can use **get** instead of **have** in 🗣 informal English too.

> You should get that fixed. It's a fire hazard, you know. <br/>
> I got the tickets delivered to my parents' address. <br/>

The same structure is possible with verbs **want**, **need**, **would** or **like**.

> I need the bike fixed by Thursday. <br/>
> What time would you like the food delivered? <br/>
> No, I don't want the windshield washed. <br/>

## Express from whom

We use the preposition **by** to express who did something for us.

> If you don't know how to set it up yourself, have it done by a professional. <br/>
> Two years ago I got my bathroom done by this company. <br/>

But we can use another phrase as well - **have + somebody + bare infinitive + something** or **get + somebody + to +
infinitive + something** (
see [Object-infinitive binding](/topics/parts-of-speech/verbs/non-finite-verb-forms/object-infinitive-binding.md)).

I'll have my father fix the car.
Wait, we'll have someone help you.
I used to have my older brother buy me beer.

> I'll get my father to fix the car. <br/>
> I'll get someone to help you! <br/>
> Can you get your brother to buy us a few beers? <br/>

> I'll get my father to fix the car. <br/>
> I'll get someone to help you! <br/>
> Can you get your brother to buy us a few beers? <br/>

## Unpleasant situations

We can use **have sth done** to describe unpleasant or unwanted situations that happened to us.

> My car was stolen last week ➡ I had my car stolen last week. <br/>
> He had his arm broken in a skiing accident. <br/>
> We had our apartment broken into this summer. They never found the culprit. <br/>
> My son had his tooth broken by another kid at school. <br/>
> The singer had her reputation ruined by the media. <br/>

We can use **get** again, although it may evoke some degree of self-inflictedness. The phrase with **get** also means
that somebody finished something.

> They got all their money stolen when they were in Mexico. <br/>
> Don't get yourselves killed! <br/>
> He finally got the book finished. <br/>
> There's a lot of work to do so let's get it done. <br/>

## Cause something to start

We can use **have / get + somebody / something + present participle + something** to say that somebody / something
causes the start of something.

> The room is a mess but I hope I'll have it looking presentable in no time. 💡*V pokoji je nepořádek, ale doufám, že to
brzy udělám tak, aby vypadal reprezentativně.* <br/>
> I finally got the engine running. 💡*Konečně se mi podařilo nastartovat motor.* <br/>
> Our accent training program will have you speaking like an American in no time. <br/>
