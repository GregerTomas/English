> My children like apples.
> John and Jill like apples. ➡ The kids and their parents like apples. 💡*multiple subject - always plural* <br/>

We use plural for countable nouns and singular for uncountable nouns.

#### Either or / neither nor

The verb depends on the closer subject.

> Either John or the kids like apples. 🆚 Either the kids or John likes apples. 💡
