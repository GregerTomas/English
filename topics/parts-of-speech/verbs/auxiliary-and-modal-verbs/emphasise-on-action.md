# Emphasise on action

💡 něco tak opravdu je, opravdu se to stalo, vážně, skutečně, fakt

We can put emphasize on an action with help of auxiliary verbs.

> She **does** know that. <br/>
> They **did** sell nice things there. <br/>
> We **do** want to go there with you. Why do you think we want to stay home? <br/>
> 🔴 I did went to school yesterday. ➡ 🟢 I did go to school yesterday. <br/>
> 🔴 He does loves her. ➡ 🟢 He does love her. <br/>
> You didn't do your homework again, Mark? I **did** do my homework, but I left it on my desk this morning. <br/>
