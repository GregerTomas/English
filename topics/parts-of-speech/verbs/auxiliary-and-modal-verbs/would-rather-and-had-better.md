# Would rather and had better

## Would rather

ðŸ’¡ radÄ›ji by

We express a wish, our preferences.

### One subject

It is used with the bare infinitive.

> I don't want to study. I'd rather go out. <br/>
> I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail. <br/>
> She'd rather watch a romcom instead of a horror movie. <br/>
> Where would you rather live, in Europe or in America? <br/>
> I'd rather not go alone. I might get lost. <br/>

### Two subjects

It is used with a subordinate sentence in the past tense even though the action is not in the past. This grammar is
called [unreal time](../conjunctive.md#unreal-time).

> Do you want me to go? No, I'd rather you stayed. <br/>
> If it's going to upset me, I'd rather you didn't say anything. <br/>
> My girlfriend's friends are joining us this weekend but I'd rather we went alone. <br/>
> Her boyfriend is too old for her. I'd rather she were with someone her age. <br/>
> He'd rather go, wouldn't he? <br/>

## Had better

ðŸ’¡ radÄ›ji bych mÄ›l udÄ›lat (aby se napÅ™. vyhnul problÃ©mÅ¯m apod.)

We can consider it as the stronger **should**. Again, it is used with the bare infinitive.

> I'd better go. My parents will be looking for me. <br/>
> You'd better study now. Otherwise you might fail the exam. <br/>
> You and your friends had better behave yourselves tonight, or else! <br/>
> Tell me what happened. You'd better not lie! <br/>
> He'd better go, hadn't he? <br/>

ðŸ—£ In the informal English, we can omit **had**.

> I better go. <br/>
> You better not say anything. <br/>
