# Maybe alternatives

## Maybe

We can use **perhaps** as well. It is a bit more formal. We use them at the beginning of a sentence.

> Maybe I'll go out with Lynn tonight. <br/>
> Maybe he doesn't understand English. <br/>
> She's not here. Maybe she's changed her mind. <br/>
> Perhaps I'll go out with Lynn tonight. <br/>

**short answer**
> Will you call me tomorrow? Maybe. <br/>
> Do you think Kate likes me? I don't know, maybe. <br/>
> Will you call me tomorrow? Perhaps. <br/>

**estimate of number or quantity**
> There were 30, maybe 40, people at the party. <br/>
> I think she's about 20, maybe 25. <br/>
> There were 30, perhaps 40, people at the party. <br/>

**proposal**
> Maybe you should stop treating her like a child. <br/>
> Maybe we should go. <br/>
> Perhaps you should stop treating her like a child. <br/>

## Probably, likely

**probably** - belongs to the [Frequency and measurement adverbs](/topics/sentence-structure/word-order.md#adverbs)

**likely** - adjective, in the binding (**to be likely to**) or in a subordinate sentence (**to be likely that**)

> He will probably be late. ➡ It's likely that he'll be late. ➡ He is likely to be late. <br/>
> It will probably rain. ➡ It's likely that it'll rain. ➡ It's likely to rain. <br/>
> He is probably at school. ➡ He's likely to be at school. ➡ He will probably spend the rest of his life in prison. = He
> is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison. <br/>
> He probably saw a lawyer. ➡ He's likely to have seen a lawyer. [⏳ Dokonavý infinitiv.]

The opposite verb for **likely** is **unlikely**. It has the same rules.

> He's unlikely to be here in time. <br/>
> It's unlikely that it'll rain today. <br/>

**Likely** can also be used as an ordinary adjective.

> I think A is the most likely answer. <br/>
> Rain is highly unlikely. <br/>
> Life on Mars is very likely. <br/>
