# Modal verbs

Modal verbs determine the so-called manner of the main meaning of the verb.

## Grammar

### Always the same form

> I can swim. <br/>
> He can swim. <br/>

### Some forms do not exist

> 🔴 **infinitive** - to must <br/>
> 🔴 **present participle** - musting <br/>
> 🔴 **past participle** - musted <br/>

Therefore, modal verbs can not be in the future tense, in any continuous tense or in the 💡dokonavém tense (for example
present perfect).

### Verb in basic form follows

> I must go. <br/>
> He should tell us the truth. <br/>
> We can't do that. <br/>

An exception is the verb **ought** with is bound with the full infinitive.

> I ought to study because there's an exam tomorrow. <br/>

### No auxiliary verb

> 🔴 Do you can help me? ➡ 🟢 Can you help me? <br/>
> 🔴 I don't can do it. ➡ 🟢 I can't do it. <br/>

## Categories

### Primary

These verbs express the extent to which someone has / does not have the freedom to perform an action - duties,
prohibitions, commands, possibilities, abilities. They are used only in the present tense, if we want use them in the
past / future tenses, we must use a verb replacement (💡 opis).

### Secondary

These verbs express the extent to which the speaker is convinced of what he is saying (something definitely is, or maybe
it is, definitely wasn't, etc.), or his current attitude or evaluation of what has already happened (e.g. that he
shouldn't have gone there - he or she went there but regrets it.)

They do not use a verb replacement. They are mostly used in the present tense as they express the current attitude. We
can use them in the past tense with help of the [⏳ Dokonavý infinitiv.].

> must have done, might have seen, should have gone <br/>

## Verbs

### Can

#### 💡 Schopnost (umět)

> I can swim. 💡*Umím plavat.* <br/>
> He can run 100 metres in 12 seconds. 💡*Uběhne 100 metrů za 12 vteřin – dovede to.* <br/>
> Can you speak Spanish? <br/>

We use the verb **could** in the past tense, and the replacement **be able to** in other tenses, as an infinitive, etc.

> I could sing very well when I was a kid. <br/>
> I want to be able to sing. <br/>
> Will people be able to do simple maths in the future? <br/>
> She's never been able to cook. <br/>

#### 💡 Mít možnost (moci)

> Can you come tonight? 💡*Můžeš dnes večer přijít?* <br/>
> I can be there at 8. 💡*Můžu tam být v osm.* <br/>

Again, we use the verb **could** and the replacement **be able to***.

> He could run like the wind. <br/>
> He couldn't come. <br/>
> I don't know when I will be able to pay for it. <br/>

#### 💡 Svolení (smět, moci, mít dovoleno)

> Can I go to the cinema with you? 💡*Můžu jít s vámi do kina? (dovolíte mi to?)* <br/>
> Of course you can. 💡*Jasně že můžeš. (máš naše svolení)* <br/>
> Can I ask you something? 💡*Smím se tě na něco zeptat?* <br/>

We use the verb **could** again, and as a replacement we use the phrase **be allowed to**.

> Was he allowed to go with them? 💡*Mohl jít s nimi? (měl to dovoleno?)* <br/>
> I've never been allowed to go out on school nights. 💡*Nikdy jsem nesměl večer ven, když byla další den škola.* <br/>

#### Could 🆚 was able to

The verb **could** expresses a general ability (someone was able to do something), and the phrase **was able to** says
that someone did something, succeeded in something.

He could run away if he wanted. 💡*Mohl utéct, kdyby chtěl.* <br/>
They caught him but he was able to run away. 💡*Chytili ho, ale podařilo se mu utéct.* <br/>

### Can't

#### 💡 Neschopnost (neumět)

> I can't swim. <br/>
> Chickens can't fly. <br/>

We use the verb **couldn't** in the past tense, and the replacement **be (not) able to** in other tenses, as an
infinitive, etc.

> I couldn't sing very well when I was a kid. <br/>
> I won't be able to learn it. <br/>

#### 💡 Nemít možnost (nemoci)

> I can't come tonight. 💡*Dnes večer nemůžu přijít.* <br/>

Again, we use the verb **couldn't** in the past tense.

> He couldn't come. <br/>

#### 💡 Nesvolení (nesmět, nemoct, nemít dovoleno)

> You can't come with us! 💡*námi nesmíš!* <br/>
> I can't talk to my parents like that. <br/>
> Can I say something? – No, you can't! <br/>

We use the verb **couldn't** again, and as a replacement we use the phrase **be (not) allowed to**.

> He couldn't go there with them. 💡*Nemohl tam s nimi jít. (neměl to dovoleno)* <br/>
> You won't be allowed to watch TV tomorrow if you don't listen to us! <br/>

### Must

#### 💡 Příkaz, uložení povinnosti (muset)

> You must be quiet. 💡*Musíš být tiše.* <br/>
> I must try harder. 💡*Musím se více snažit.* <br/>

It is used only in the present tense, but can express even obligations in the future. In other cases, we must use the
replacement **have to**.

> You must help me tomorrow. <br/>
> I had to stay at home. <br/>
> I'll have to try it next year. <br/>

#### 💡 Důrazná rada

> You must study every day if you want to learn something. <br/>

#### Must 🆚 have to

While **must** always commands an obligation (the obligation comes from the speaker), **have to** only announces it (the
obligation comes from circumstances, rules, or other speakers).

> You must get up. <br/>
> You have to get up at six, don't you? 💡*povinnost vyplývající z okolností - pracovní doba začíná v sedm* <br/>
> I must study tonight. <br/>
> I have to study tonight. <br/>

### Musn't

#### 💡 Zákaz (nesmět)

> You mustn't go there. 💡*Nesmíš tam chodit.* <br/>
> We mustn't cheat during tests. <br/>

It is used only in the present tense, but can express even obligations in the future. In the past tense we can use **
couldn't** or **be (not) allowed to**.

> We mustn't lose the match tomorrow. <br/>
> I couldn't go to the cinema. <br/>
> We weren't allowed to use a calculator. <br/>

#### 💡 Důrazná rada

> You mustn't fidget when you go to an interview. 💡*Nesmíš se ošívat, když jdeš na pohovor.* <br/>

#### The replacement

| modal verb | replacement                           |
|------------|---------------------------------------|
| must       | have to                               |
| musn't     | 🔴 not have to ➡ 🟢 be not allowed to |

So the replacement **have to** is equivalent to *muset/nemuset* in Czech.
