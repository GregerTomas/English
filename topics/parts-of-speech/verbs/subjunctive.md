# Subjunctive

## Unreal time

When we speak in an unreal context, we use the **past tense** for future and present time and the **past perfect** for
past time.

### Wish sentences

💡 kéž by, kdyby tak

We can use the verb **wish** or a phrase **if only**.

> I wish you were here. <br/>
> I wish he returned tomorrow. <br/>
> If only I were taller. <br/>
> I wish I had studied harder. <br/>
> If only he had been more careful. <br/>

⏳ see wish-clauses

### Unreal conditionals

💡 co by se stalo kdyby, co by se bývalo stalo kdyby

> If they didn't have kids, they would break up. <br/>
> If she had the time tomorrow, she would help us. <br/>
> If you hadn't called me yesterday, I would have gone out with someone else. <br/>

#### What if, suppose, supposing, imagine

These words put more focus on what these situations could have caused.

> What if we stayed here? 💡*Co kdybychom tu zůstali?* <br/>
> What if they had been killed? 💡*Co když je někdo zabil?* <br/>
> Supposing you were caught? <br/>
> Imagine you won the lottery! What would you buy? <br/>
> Suppose someone stole your wallet. Would you go to the police? <br/>

If the real condition is used, no tense shift is used (basically it is equivalent to a conditional sentence).

> Suppose someone stole your wallet. Would you go to the police? ➡ If someone stole your wallet, would you go to the
> police? <br/>
> Suppose someone steals your wallet. Will you go to the police? ➡ If someone steals your wallet, will you go to the
> police? <br/>

#### As if, as though

> She acts as if she didn't know him. <br/>
> He looks as if he had been hit by a truck. <br/>

There is no tense shift with real conditions again (or we do not want to express an unreality). We do not use it either
after 🗣 informal **look lik*e*, **feel like**, **sound like** or **act like**.

> She acts as if she doesn't know him. <br/>
> She acts like she doesn't know him. <br/>

| condition | translation    |
|-----------|----------------|
| real      | 💡*jako když*  |     
| unreal    | 💡*jako kdyby* |

### It's time

> It's time we left. ➡ We should leave. 💡*Měli bychom odejít* <br/>
> It's high time you told me the truth. ➡ You really should tell me the truth. <br/>
> It's about time you stopped smoking. <br/>

If we do not mean the **should** meaning, we use **it's time** with an infinitive.

> It's time to go. 💡*Je čas jít* <br/>

### I would rather

We use unreal time if the subject and the object are different.

> I'd rather she asked someone else. <br/>
> I want to help you. I'd rather you didn't. <br/>
> I'd rather you hadn't said that. <br/>
> I'd rather you went with someone else. 🆚 I'd rather go with someone else. <br/>
> He'd rather stay home. <br/>

⏳I would rather / had better

### Unreal sentences with would

In Czech, the subjunctive (💡*podmiňovací způsob*) is used in both sentences, in English only in the main one.

> He says he would do what he could to help. 💡*Říká, že by udělal, co by mohl, aby pomohl.* <br/>
> He has parents who would give him anything he wanted. 💡*Má rodiče, kteří by mu dali všechno, co by chtěl.* <br/>
> Under normal circumstances I would do whatever she asked. <br/>
