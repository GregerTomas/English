# Conjunctive

💡 spojovací způsob

## Unreal time

When we speak in an unreal context, we use the **past tense** for future and present time and the **past perfect** for
past time.

It is not affected in any way by the so-called temporal sequence (💡*časova souslednost*).

> I wish I were an angel. ➡ 🔴 He said he wished **he had been** an angel. ➡ 🟢 He said he wished **he were** an
> angel. <br/>

### Wish clauses

💡 kéž by, kdyby tak

We can use the verb **wish** or a phrase **if only**.

> I wish you were here. <br/>
> I wish he returned tomorrow. <br/>
> If only I were taller. <br/>
> I wish I had studied harder. <br/>
> If only he had been more careful. <br/>

See [wish clauses](/topics/subordinate-clauses/wish-clauses.md).

### Unreal conditionals

💡 co by se stalo kdyby, co by se bývalo stalo kdyby

> If they didn't have kids, they would break up. <br/>
> If she had the time tomorrow, she would help us. <br/>
> If you hadn't called me yesterday, I would have gone out with someone else. <br/>

#### What if, suppose, supposing, imagine

These words put more focus on what these situations could have caused.

> What if we stayed here? 💡*Co kdybychom tu zůstali?* <br/>
> What if they had been killed? 💡*Co když je někdo zabil?* <br/>
> Supposing you were caught? <br/>
> Imagine you won the lottery! What would you buy? <br/>
> Suppose someone stole your wallet. Would you go to the police? <br/>

If the real condition is used, no tense shift is used (basically it is equivalent to a conditional sentence).

> Suppose someone stole your wallet. Would you go to the police? ➡ If someone stole your wallet, would you go to the
> police? <br/>
> Suppose someone steals your wallet. Will you go to the police? ➡ If someone steals your wallet, will you go to the
> police? <br/>

#### As if, as though

> She acts as if she didn't know him. <br/>
> He looks as if he had been hit by a truck. <br/>

There is no tense shift with real conditions again (or we do not want to express an unreality). We do not use it either
after 🗣 informal **look lik*e*, **feel like**, **sound like** or **act like**.

> She acts as if she doesn't know him. <br/>
> She acts like she doesn't know him. <br/>

| condition | translation    |
|-----------|----------------|
| real      | 💡*jako když*  |     
| unreal    | 💡*jako kdyby* |

### It's time

> It's time we left. ➡ We should leave. 💡*Měli bychom odejít* <br/>
> It's high time you told me the truth. ➡ You really should tell me the truth. <br/>
> It's about time you stopped smoking. <br/>

If we do not mean the **should** meaning, we use **it's time** with an infinitive.

> It's time to go. 💡*Je čas jít* <br/>

### I would rather

We use unreal time if the subject and the object are different.

> I'd rather she asked someone else. <br/>
> I want to help you. I'd rather you didn't. <br/>
> I'd rather you hadn't said that. <br/>
> I'd rather you went with someone else. 🆚 I'd rather go with someone else. <br/>
> He'd rather stay home. <br/>

⏳I would rather / had better

### Unreal sentences with would

In Czech, the subjunctive (💡*podmiňovací způsob*) is used in both sentences, in English only in the main one.

> He says he would do what he could to help. 💡*Říká, že by udělal, co by mohl, aby pomohl.* <br/>
> He has parents who would give him anything he wanted. 💡*Má rodiče, kteří by mu dali všechno, co by chtěl.* <br/>
> Under normal circumstances I would do whatever she asked. <br/>

## Conjunctive

We use it in sentences with unreal time or if we express our opinions, proposals or recommendations.

| pronoun                                   | present conjunctive | past conjunctive  |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| I / you / he / she / it / we / you / they | be / have / go      | were / had / went |

It does not matter if the sentence is in present / past tense - we can use both conjunctives.

### Use with unreal time

> If I were younger, I would travel around the world. <br/>
> I wish it were Christmas already. <br/>
> She looked as if she were saying goodbye. <br/>
> I'd rather she were with someone her age. <br/>
> What if he were a killer? <br/>

See also [unreal time](#unreal-time). We can use simple past present in this case.

### Wishes

💡 nechť, kéž, ať

It is actually used only in established phrases.

> God save the Queen! 💡*Nechť Bůh ochraňuje Královnu.* <br/>
> God help us! <br/>
> Long live the king! <br/>
> (God) bless you! <br/>
> God forbid / Heavens forbid! <br/>
> So be it! <br/>
> Peace be with you! <br/>
> Truth be told ... 💡*Popravdě řečeno ...* <br/>

A sentence can start with **may** as well.

> Come what may ... 💡*Ať se stane, co se stane ...* <br/>
> Be that as it may ... 💡*Ať je to jakkoliv ...* <br/>
> Try as he might ... 💡*Ať se snažíl, jak se snažil ...* <br/>
> May the force be with you! <br/>
