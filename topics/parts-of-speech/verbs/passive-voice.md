**be + past participle**

## Creation

The verb **be** is put to the correct form according to the tense in the active voice sentence.

## Passive voice 🆚 ergative verbs

💡 Pomocí ergativních sloves je na nějaký děj pohlíženo nikoliv z pohledu činitele (kdo co udělal) ale z pohledu věci,
která je dějem ovlivněna.

### Transitive / intransitive verbs

A **transitive verb** is typically used with an object. In opposite, an **intransitive verb** can not have an object.
Some verbs belongs to both categories.

> I have a dog 💡*transitive* <br/>
> 🔴 He is sleeping something ➡ 🟢 He is sleeping. 💡*intransitive* <br/>
> I read a magazine every day. 💡*transitive* 🆚 I read every day. 💡*intransitive* <br/>

### Ergative verbs?

We can omit an object when using a transitive verb, but we must use the logical object as the subject. The ergative
verbs does not care about the executor of an action, in opposite, the passive voice express the executor at least
slightly.

> 🔴 I opened nebo they opened. 💡*missing object* <br/>
> The door opened. <br/>
> A new supermarket opened in our town. <br/>

This category of verbs can be divided to a few categories, but they do not include all verbs.
For some verbs we must use an adverbial determination (well, easily, ...).

> Careful! It would break if you dropped it. <br/>
> The main sail tore in half. <br/>
> You should use thick cardboard that doesn't bend easily. <br/>
> Weather conditions finally improved. <br/>
> Look, my T-shirt has shrunk! <br/>
> The vase shattered when it hit the ground. <br/>
> Blood drained from his face. <br/>
> The lights dimmed. <br/>
> The snow melted. <br/>

> The sweater washes well. <br/>
> The book sells like crazy and it reads smoothly. <br/>
