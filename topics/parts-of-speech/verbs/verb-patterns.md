# Verb patterns

It is a situation when there is one verb after another one.

## Verbs followed by bare infinitive

### Modal verbs

> can, may, must, could, might, will, would, shall, should <br/>

> I can do it. <br/>
> May I help you? <br/>
> You must obey! <br/>

### Let / make

> Let me open the door for you. 💡*Dovolte mi otevřít vám dveře.* <br/>
> Don't make me laugh! 💡*Nenuť mě se smát.* <br/>

We use the infinitive with **to** in the passive voice -
see [object-infinitive binding](non-finite-verb-forms/object-infinitive-binding.md).

> I was made to do it. <br/>

### Help

We can use both types of the infinitive (full or bare).

> He helped her open the door. <br/>
> He helped her to open the door. <br/>

### Dare

💡 opovážit se, troufnout si

We can use both types of the infinitive (full or bare). It belongs to group of verbs after which are followed by an
object and then by the infinitive (see [this article](#verb---object---verb)).

> I didn't dare (to) go. <br/>
> Do you dare (to) do it? <br/>
> Nobody dared (to) speak. <br/>
> I dare you to drink it! <br/>

## Infinitive 🆚 gerund

### General help

❗This rule is far from 100%.

The **gerund** is often used when the action described by the second verb takes place before the action described by the
first verb.

> She denied stealing the money. 💡*popírá něco, co udělala dříve* <br/>

The **infinitive** has the opposite rule, the first verb takes place before the second verb, the verbs follow each other
chronologically.

> She decided to steal the money. 💡*nejprve se rozhodla a pak ukradla* <br/>

### Hear / see

**hear / see + bare infinitive** 💡*dokonové, viděli nebo slyšeli jsme celou akci*

**hear / see + gerund** 💡*nedokonavé, viděli nebo slyšeli jsme pouze část*

We can not use the full infinitive with these verbs.

> I saw him cross the street. 🆚 I saw him crossing the street. <br/>
> He saw the tree fall down. 🆚 He saw the tree falling down. <br/>
> I heard her knock on the door. 🆚 I heard her knocking on the door. <br/>
> She heard her parents argue in their bedroom. 🆚 She heard he parents arguing in their bedroom. <br/>

### The same meaning

If there is a gerund in the sentence, we prefer the infinitive, otherwise it does not matter whether the infinitive or
the gerund is used.

> **advise** ➡ She advised me to wait. / She advised waiting. <br/>
> **can't bear** ➡ I can't bear to wait / waiting in long lines. 💡*Nesnesu čekat ve dlouhých frontách.*<br/>
> **begin** ➡ It began to rain / raining. <br/>
> **continue** ➡ He continued to speak / speaking. <br/>
> **prefer** ➡ Janet prefers to walk home. / I prefer walking to running. <br/>
> **start** ➡ It started to rain / raining. <br/>

> 🔴 It's starting raining. ➡ 🟢 It's starting to rain. <br/>
> It started raining. ➡ It started to rain. <br/>

#### Advise

If there is an object in the sentence, we must use the infinitive, otherwise the gerund. We use the infinitive in the
passive voice even for sentences without an object.

> He advised me to buy a Volvo. <br/>
> He advised buying a Volvo. <br/>
> I was advised to buy a Volvo. <br/>

#### Prefer

Typically, it is used with the infinitive. It is used with the preposition **to** - so the next verb must be in the
gerund (or we must say it in a different way).

> I prefer to stay home. <br/>
> I prefer tea to coffee. <br/>
> I prefer staying home to going to the concert. <br/>
> ➡ I'd prefer to stay home rather than to go to the concert. <br/>
> ➡ I'd prefer to stay home than go to the concert. <br/>
