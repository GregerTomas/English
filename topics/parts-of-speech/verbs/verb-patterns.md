# Verb patterns

It is a situation when there is one verb after another one.

## Verbs followed by bare infinitive

### Modal verbs

> can, may, must, could, might, will, would, shall, should <br/>

> I can do it. <br/>
> May I help you? <br/>
> You must obey! <br/>

### Let / make

> Let me open the door for you. 💡*Dovolte mi otevřít vám dveře.* <br/>
> Don't make me laugh! 💡*Nenuť mě se smát.* <br/>

We use the infinitive with **to** in the passive voice -
see [object-infinitive binding](non-finite-verb-forms/object-infinitive-binding.md).

> I was made to do it. <br/>

### Help

We can use both types of the infinitive (full or bare).

> He helped her open the door. <br/>
> He helped her to open the door. <br/>

### Dare

💡 opovážit se, troufnout si

We can use both types of the infinitive (full or bare). It belongs to group of verbs after which are followed by an
object and then by the infinitive (see [this article](#verb---object---verb)).

> I didn't dare (to) go. <br/>
> Do you dare (to) do it? <br/>
> Nobody dared (to) speak. <br/>
> I dare you to drink it! <br/>
