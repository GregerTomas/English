# Conjunctions

## Because 🆚 because of

**because** 💡protože

**because of** 💡kvůli

**Because** is a conjunction and we use a subordinate clause after it. In opposite, because of is a prepositional phrase
and we use a noun or a pronoun after it.

> My new assistant can even write in shorthand. <br/>

### Emphasize a conjunction

We can use it together with a conjunction, but can never stand alone as a conjunction.

#### Even if

💡i kdyby, i když

> She won't come, even if you invite her in person. <br/>
> We will go, even if the weather is bad. <br/>
> Even if I knew the answer, I wouldn't tell you. <br/>

It is equivalent of **although**.

> Even though I'm 30, I still can't swim. <br/>
> I still get their newsletter, even though I unsubscribed long ago. <br/>
> She married him, even though he is 30 years older than her. <br/>

#### Even when

💡i když

It is not a conjunction, it just emphasizes the conjunction **when**.

> in. <br/>

> I am tired even when I sleep for eight hours. <br/>
> He always works, even when he is at home. <br/>

## When 🆚 if

**when** is a time conjunction, in opposite **if** is a conditional conjunction.

We do not often use a future tense after them, but that is not always true.

> 🔴 If I will see him, I will tell him to call you. ➡ 🟢 If I see him, I will tell him to call you. <br/>
> 🔴 When I will see him, I will tell him to call you. ➡ 🟢 When I see him, I will tell him to call you. <br/>

### In the past

> I saw Buckingham Palace when I was in London. <br/>.
> I don't know when he arrived. 💡*Nevím, kdy dorazil.* 🆚 I don't know if he arrived. 💡*Nevím, jestli dorazil.* <br/>

### In the future

**when** 💡když, až

**if** 💡když, pokud, jestli ➡ **1st conditional**

> When I see him, I will tell him. = Až ho uvidím, řeknu mu to. 💡*Vím, že ho uvidím. Je to jen otázka času, kdy se tak
stane.* 🆚 If I see him, I will tell him. = Pokud ho uvidím, řeknu mu to. 💡*Nevím, jestli ho uvidím. Pokud se tak stane,
řeknu mu to.* <br/>
> I don't know when he'll come. 💡*Nevím, kdy přijde.* 🆚 I don't know if he'll come. 💡*Nevím, jestli přijde.* <br/>

### In the present

**when = if** 💡když, pokud, jestli ➡ **2nd conditional**

> If you water plants, they grow. 💡*Pokud/Jestli zalijete rostliny, rostou.* <br/>
> When you water plants, they grow. 💡*Když zalijete rostliny, rostou.* <br/>

## Until 🆚 unless

Until can be used a a preposition as well.

**until** (time conjunction) 💡dokud ne (kdy)

**unless** (conditional conjunction) 💡pokud ne (jestli)

Be aware of the future tense and the double negation.

> 🔴 I'll wait for you here until you will come back. ➡ 🟢 I'll wait for you here until you come back. <br/>
> 🔴 I'll come at 5 unless there will be a traffic jam. ➡ 🟢 I'll come at 5 unless there is a traffic jam. <br/>
> 🔴 I'll wait for you here until you don't come back. ➡ 🟢 I'll wait for you here until you come back. <br/>
> 🔴 I'll come at 5 unless there isn't a traffic jam. ➡ 🟢 I'll come at 5 unless there is a traffic jam. <br/>

> I'll stay there until you call me. 💡*Zůstanu tam, dokud mi nezavoláš (než mi zavoláš).* <br/>
> I'll stay there unless you call me. 💡*Zůstanu tam, pokud mi nezavoláš (jestli mi zavoláš).* <br/>

We can use **if not** instead of **unless**.

> I'll stay there unless you call me. ➡ I'll stay there if you don't call me. <br/>
> You won't pass the exam unless you study hard. ➡ You won't pass the exam if you don't study hard. <br/>

> home. <br/>

We can use **till** instead of **until.

> I'll wait for you here until you come back. ➡ I'll wait for you here till you come back. <br/>
> I'll stay there until you call me. ➡ I'll stay there till you call me. <br/>
> You're not going outside until you clean your room. ➡ You're not going outside till you clean your room. <br/>

## Whether

💡jestli, zda, zdali

### Conditionals

We can not use it in the conditional sentences.

> 🔴 We would have died whether they hadn't saved us. ➡ 🟢 We would have died if they hadn't saved us. <br/>

### Object clauses

We can often use both **whether** and **if**, whether is in this case more ✏formal.

> I don't know whether / if we'll make it. <br/>
> Could you tell me whether / if Mr Smith is in his office? <br/>
> I don't know whether / if I should trust her. <br/>

We must use **whether** in following cases.

#### A subordinate clause after preposition

> 🔴 He was worried about if he would get the job or not. ➡ 🟢 He was worried about whether he would get the job or
> not. <br/>
> We still had no answer to whether if they would do it or not. <br/>
> The investors wrestled with whether they should invest in our company. <br/>

#### Object with infinitive phrase

> 🔴 I don't know if to apply to Oxford or Cambridge. ➡ 🟢 I don't know whether to apply to Oxford or Cambridge. <br/>
> She's still considering whether to take the job. <br/>
> You have to choose whether to continue with the relationship or bail out. <br/>

#### Whether or not

> 🔴 I don't know if I should trust her. ➡ 🟢 I don't know whether or not I should trust her. <br/>
> She didn't say whether or not she would be here for dinner. <br/>

If we use **or not** at the end of the sentence, we can even use **if**.

> I don't know whether I should trust her or not. ➡ I don't know if I should trust her or not. <br/>
> She didn't say whether she would be here for dinner or not. ➡ She didn't say if she would be here for dinner or
> not. <br/>

#### Object clauses at beginning of sentence

> Whether I passed the test I don't know yet. <br/>

#### After verb be

> The question is whether he was telling the truth. <br/>

### Relative clauses

We can replace it with **if** unless it is followed by an infinitive or **whether or not** phrase.

> He raised a question whether the proposal was feasible. ➡ He raised a question whether / if the proposal was feasible.
> 🔴 He raised a question if to go ahead with the plan. ➡ 🟢 He raised a question whether to go ahead with the plan. <br/>
> 🔴 He raised a question if or not they should go ahead with the plan. ➡ 🟢 He raised a question whether or not they
> should go ahead with the plan. <br/>
