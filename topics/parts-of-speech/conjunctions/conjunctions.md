# Conjunctions

## Because 🆚 because of

**because** 💡protože

**because of** 💡kvůli

**Because** is a conjunction and we use a subordinate clause after it. In opposite, because of is a prepositional phrase
and we use a noun or a pronoun after it.

We can use a noun, a pronoun, a preposition or a verb after it.

> My new assistant can even write in shorthand. <br/>

### Emphasize a conjunction

We can use it together with a conjunction, but can never stand alone as a conjunction.

💡i kdyby, i když

> She won't come, even if you invite her in person. <br/>
> We will go, even if the weather is bad. <br/>
> Even if I knew the answer, I wouldn't tell you. <br/>

💡ačkoli, přestože, i když

It is equivalent of **although**.

> Even though I'm 30, I still can't swim. <br/>
> I still get their newsletter, even though I unsubscribed long ago. <br/>
> She married him, even though he is 30 years older than her. <br/>

#### Even when

💡i když

It is not a conjunction, it just emphasizes the conjunction **when**.

> The search engine even works when you aren't signed in. 🆚 The search engine works even when you aren't signed
> in. <br/>

> I am tired even when I sleep for eight hours. <br/>
> He always works, even when he is at home. <br/>
> Even when she is very tired, she always cooks a nice dinner. <br/>
