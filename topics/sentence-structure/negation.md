## Expressing a negation

We have countless possibilities how to express negation.

### No

💡*ne*

**No** is not a sentence negation. It is not a part of the sentence, and it is separated by a comma.

It is impossible to use it as a side sentence (*věta vedlejší*).

> No! <br/>
> Oh no. <br/>
> No, I did not see him on Monday. <br/>
> 🔴 I think no. ➡ 🟢 I do not think so. <br/>
> 🔴 He said that no. ➡ 🟢 He said "no" (direct speech). <br/>
> 🔴 He liked the book but I no. ➡ 🟢 He liked the book but I did not. <br/>
> 🔴 I was hungry but he no. ➡ 🟢 I was hungry but he was not. <br/>

### No (as determiner)

💡*žádný*

In this case **no** stands before a noun. If a noun has adjectives, it stands before all adjectives.

> There was no snow. <br/>
> I have no money. <br/>
> If there are no questions, we can end the meeting. <br/>
> I have no money. <br/>
> There were no people. <br/>

Most often it is used with a **uncountable noun** (no money, no air, no snow, no water, no information, ...) or with
a **plural noun** (no people, no trees, no children, no pencils, ...).

Rarely can be used with a singular noun (except when we want to add emphasis on the **no**).

> I knocked but there was no answer. <br/>
> She has no child. ➡ She does not have a child. <br/>
> No child should suffer discrimination. <br/>
> No question is a stupid question. <br/>

### Not

We use **not** as a negation of a sentence.

> I am not a good player. <br/>
> He liked the book but I did not. <br/>

**Not** can stand before:

* noun
* pronoun
* adverb
* adverbial determination
* fragment (an incomplete sentence)

> Not me. <br/>
> Not today. <br/>
> Not now. <br/>
> I will tell you about it but not here. <br/>

We use a phrase **or not** *(💡nebo ne)* as follows:
> We will go there whether you like it or not. <br/>
> We could go out. Or not <br/>

#### Phrases with NOT

##### Not really

💡*ne tak docela, ani ne*

We can use it if we do not want to use just "no" outright.

> Did you like the movie? Not really. <br/>
> Did she thank you for the flowers? Not really. <br/>
> Did you apologize to him? Not really. <br/>
> Do you feel like going out? Not really. <br/>

##### Not at all

💡*vůbec ne*

When we use **at all** in a negative sentence, we add emphasis on negation.

> I do not like him at all. <br/>
> Do you mind if I open the window? Not at all. <br/>
> Did I offend you in any way? Oh, not at all. <br/>

##### Not yet

💡*ještě ne*

> Have you finished? Not yet. <br/>
> Has Susan seen your new boyfriend? Not yet. <br/>
> Are you ready? Not yet. <br/>

##### Not anymore

💡*už ne*

We use **not anymore** in questions where we ask whether something is true or not. Words like **still**, **yet** often
appear in these questions.

> Do you still live here? Not anymore. <br/>
> Does she still love him? No, not anymore. <br/>
> Do you want to come with us? Not anymore. <br/>

##### Not necessarily

💡*nutně ne, není to tak jisté*

> Do we have to arrive by 9? Not necessarily. <br/>
> She will get fired. Not necessarily. <br/>

### None

pronoun

> He wanted to buy some books, but he got none. *(none = no books)* <br/>
> I asked my friends for help but none helped me. *(none = no friends)* <br/>
> Did you drink all the beer? There is none left in the fridge. *(none = no beer)* <br/>
> 🔴 I have none friends. ➡ 🟢 I have no friends. <br/>
> 🔴 There is no in the fridge. ➡ 🟢 There is none in the fridge. <br/>

#### Phrases with NONE

##### None of

💡*žádný z*
> None of them helped me. <br/>
> None of the children brought an umbrella. <br/>
> None of the money went to charity. <br/>
> None of the students is/are very smart. <br/>

If we use **none of** with a plural noun, we can then use either singular (✏formal) or plural verb (🗣informal).

##### None other than

💡*nikdo jiný než*

> I realized that the person in front of me was no other than mz mother. <br/>
> It was revealed that Robert I. was no other than Robert II. <br/>

##### None but ✏

💡*pouze*

✏formal variant of **only**

> He says that French cuisine is for none but the brave. <br/>
> None but you can help me. <br/>

##### None the + comparative

💡*o nic lepší / moudřejší / ...*

> He is none the better than you. <br/>
> She did apologize to him, but he felt none the better. <br/>
> She has explained everything but I'm none the wiser. <br/>

We can use this phrase with the preposition **for** *(💡i přesto, že ...)*. The same meaning has **nonetheless** *(⏳)*.

> She explained it to me, but I was none the wiser for it. <br/>
> He knew his decision had been the right one, but he felt none the better for it. <br/>
> He was none the richer for the gift. <br/>
> I was none the wiser for the information. <br/>
> I almost died but, in the end, I was none the worse for the experience. <br/>

### Neither

determiner or pronoun

Almost the similar usage to **no** and **none**, but in this case we talk about two things.

> Neither parent had money to support the child. *(mother or father)* <br/>
> No parent likes to see their child unhappy. *(parents generally)* <br/>

**Neither** can be used with a singular noun (neither parent), with a preposition (neither of the parents) or as a
pronoun.
> Neither eye was damaged. <br/>
> Neither answer was right. <br/>
> She liked neither option. <br/>
> She liked neither of her two math teachers. <br/>
> Neither of the parents was / were present. <br/>
> If neither of the teams score/scores, it's a draw. <br/>
> Which one do you like, the black one or the green one? Neither. <br/>
> I thought she would kill me or at least hit me, but she did neither. <br/>

As with **none of**, if we use **neither of** with a plural noun, we can then use either singular (✏formal) or plural
verb (🗣informal).

We can use **neither** together with **nor** (💡*ani to, ani ono*).

> She liked neither the blue one nor the red one. <br/>
> She neither killed me nor hit me. <br/>

### Nobody / no one / nothing

pronouns

* nobody = no one (*used with persons*) 💡*nikdo, nikoho, nikomu*
* nothing *(used with things)*💡*nic*

> No one helped me. <br/>
> She had nothing in her pockets. <br/>
> I'm sorry. There is nothing I can do about it. <br/>

Pay attention to the difference between **nobody** / **no one** / **nothing** and **none**. **None** can be used both
with persons and things, but it must have any context.

> None helped me. *(context: I asked my friends for help.)* <br/>
> No one helped me. *(generally)* <br/>
> I found none. *(context: I was searching for my friends.)* <br/>
> I found nothing. *(generally)* <br/>

### Never

> I have never been to Italy. <br/>

### Until / unless

💡*dokud a pokud*

We use a positive sentence after both **until** and **unless**.

> We'll wait until you return. 💡*Počkáme, dokud se nevrátíš.* <br/>
> I won't tell you my name unless you tell me yours. 💡*Neřeknu ti, jak se jmenuju, pokud mi neřekneš, jak se jmenuješ
ty.* <br/>

### Words with negative meaning

Words like **hardly**, **rarely**, **seldom**, **unlikely**, **fail**, **deny**, ... have a negative meaning.

> I can hardly hear anything. 💡*Skoro nic neslyším.* <br/>
> Hardly anybody came to the party. 💡*Skoro nikdo nepřišel na párty.* <br/>
> I have hardly any money. 💡*Nemám skoro žádné peníze.* <br/>
> We're unlikely to see anything. 💡*Pravděpodobně nic neuvidíme.* <br/>

### Usage of negation and really

💡*opravdu, vážně, skutečně*

##### positive sentences ➡ still the same meaning

> I really like it. 💡*Opravdu se mi to líbí.* <br/>
> She really missed you. 💡*Vážně jsi jí chyběl.* <br/>

##### negative sentences ➡ the meaning depends on the possition

* before the negative (strong) 💡*vůbec ne, opravdu ne*
* after the negative (soft) 💡*ani ne, v podstatě ne, ani moc ne*

> I really don't want to go there. 💡*Opravdu tam nechci jít.* <br/>
> I don't really want to go there. 💡*Ani tam moc nechci jít.* <br/>
> She really didn't understand him. 💡*Opravdu mu nerozuměla.* <br/>
> She didn't really understand him. 💡*Ani mu moc nerozuměla.* <br/>

> I didn't really know what to say. <br/>
> She didn't really like the desert, but didn't say anything. <br/>
> I don't really want to go with you. <br/>
> My parents don't really know him. <br/>
> I'm glad he's been fired. I never really liked him. <br/>

### Ain't 🗣

💡*nebýt, není, nejsem, nejsi, ...*

A very informal negative form of the verb **be** and sometimes of other verbs.

> You aren't going anywhere. ➡ You ain't going nowhere. <br/>
> I haven't got any money. ➡ I ain't got no money. <br/>
> He hasn't seen anything. ➡ He ain't seen nothing. <br/>

### Summary

Usually the negation stands with the verb and the rest of the sentence is positive (alternatively it contains **
anything**,
**anyone**, **anybody**, **anywhere**).

We can use a positive verb with another type of negation like **no**, **none**, **nobody**, **no one**, **nothing**, **
never**, **nowhere**,
**neither**.

If a subject is negative (**nobody**, **nothing**, **none**, **neither**), the verb and all other parts of the sentences
are positive.
If an adverb **never** is included, the rest of the sentence is positive.

## Transferred negation

A transferring the negation of the subordinate clause to the verb of the main clause.

> I want you not to go there. ➡ I don't want you to go there. <br/>
> This is what I think: You shouldn't do it. ➡ I don't think you should do it. <br/>
> This is what I think: It won't help. ➡ I don't think it will help. <br/>
> This is what I think: He doesn't live here anymore. ➡ I don't think he lives here anymore. <br/>
> This is what I think: She will never change. ➡ I don't think she will ever change. <br/>
> This is what I think: Nothing happened. ➡ I don't think anything happened. <br/>
> This is what I thought: You can't do it. ➡ I didn't think you could do it. <br/>
> This is what I always thought: It doesn't matter. ➡ I never thought it mattered. <br/>

Not every verb causes the transferred negation. Only verbs expressing our thoughts (**think**, **suppose**, **believe**
, **feel**,
**imagine**) and how something appears to us (**seem**, **appear**) do so. In opposite, for example **wish**, **guess**
, **bet**, **hope** do not so.

> I don't think you realise what this means. You could lose your job over this. <br/>
> I didn't tell her where I was going because I didn't suppose she'd care. <br/>
> Hi, I don't believe we've met. I'm Richie. <br/>
> Her parents didn't feel he was good enough for her. <br/>
> I did not expect you to do that. <br/>
> I do not want you to do that. <br/>
> He's flunking out of school and he doesn't seem to care. <br/>
> My question doesn't appear to be answered in the FAQ. <br/>
> 🔴 I don't wish it was. ➡ 🟢 I wish it wasn't true. <br/>
> 🔴 I don't guess he is. ➡ 🟢 I guess he's not happy. <br/>
> 🔴 I don't hope it is. ➡ 🟢 I hope it's not going to rain. <br/>
> 🔴 I don't bet you knew. ➡ 🟢 I bet you didn't know. <br/>

## Negative concord

In Czech (even in 🗣 informal English), we use multiple negations in sentences which are negative as well. Contrary, in
English only one negation is possible.

> Nobody has ever done anything to me. 💡*Nikdo mi nikdy nic neudělal.* <br/>

<hr/>

## Double concord

Double negation behaves like logical negation - two negations are erased and the meaning of a sentence is positive.

> He did not say nothing. 💡*ne, že nic neřekl / něco řekl*

There are two types of negation:

* **lexical** - prefixes (**un-**, **in-**, **im-**, ...) / suffixes (**-less**, **-free**, ...)
* **grammatical** - do not, nobody, ...

### Lexical + grammatical negation

More often than [two grammatical negation](#two-grammatical-negations).

> It wasn't impossible. ➡ It was possible. 💡*grammatical - wasn't, lexical - impossible* <br/>
> Sarah isn't unattractive. ➡ Sarah is attractive. 💡*grammatical - isn't, lexical - unattractive* <br/>
> Nobody can do it without money. 💡*grammatical - nobody, lexical - without* <br/>
> It's not hopeless, there's hope! 💡*grammatical - is not, lexical - hopeless* <br/>

### Two grammatical negations

> I don't like doing nothing. ➡ I like doing nothing. 💡*grammatical - negative main clause and negative secondary
subject clause* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> I don't like doing anything <br/>

> I can't not say anything about it. ➡ I must say something. 🆚 I can't say anything about it. <br/>
> Nobody has never made a mistake. ➡ Everyone has made a mistake. 🆚 Nobody has ever made a mistake. <br/>
> Nobody had nothing to say to me. <br/>
> Nothing ever happens for no reason at all. <br/>
> Not a day passed when she did not receive a card or letter from him. <br/>
