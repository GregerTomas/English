## Expressing a negation

We have countless possibilities how to express negation.

### No

💡*ne*

**No** is not a sentence negation. It is not a part of the sentence, and it is separated by a comma.

It is impossible to use it as a side sentence (*věta vedlejší*).

> No! <br/>
> Oh no. <br/>
> No, I did not see him on Monday. <br/>
> 🔴 I think no. ➡ 🟢 I do not think so. <br/>
> 🔴 He said that no. ➡ 🟢 He said "no" (direct speech). <br/>
> 🔴 He liked the book but I no. ➡ 🟢 He liked the book but I did not. <br/>
> 🔴 I was hungry but he no. ➡ 🟢 I was hungry but he was not. <br/>

### No (as determiner)

💡*žádný*

In this case **no** stands before a noun. If a noun has adjectives, it stands before all adjectives.

> There was no snow. <br/>
> I have no money. <br/>
> If there are no questions, we can end the meeting. <br/>
> I have no money. <br/>
> There were no people. <br/>

Most often it is used with a **uncountable noun** (no money, no air, no snow, no water, no information, ...) or with
a **plural noun** (no people, no trees, no children, no pencils, ...).

Rarely can be used with a singular noun (except when we want to add emphasis to the **no**).

> I knocked but there was no answer. <br/>
> She has no child. ➡ She does not have a child. <br/>
> No child should suffer discrimination. <br/>
> No question is a stupid question. <br/>

### Not

We are using **not** as a negation of a sentence.

> I am not a good player. <br/>
> He liked the book but I did not. <br/>

**Not** can stand before:

* noun
* pronoun
* adverb
* adverbial determination
* fragment (an incomplete sentence)

> Not me. <br/>
> Not today. <br/>
> Not now. <br/>
> I will tell you about it but not here. <br/>

We are using a phrase **or not** *(💡nebo ne)* as follows:
> We will go there whether you like it or not. <br/>
> We could go out. Or not <br/>
