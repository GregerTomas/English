## Expressing a negation

We have countless possibilities how to express negation.

### No

💡*ne*

**No** is not a sentence negation. It is not a part of the sentence, and it is separated by a comma.

It is impossible to use it as a side sentence (*věta vedlejší*).

> No! <br/>
> Oh no. <br/>
> No, I did not see him on Monday. <br/>
> 🔴 I think no. ➡ 🟢 I do not think so. <br/>
> 🔴 He said that no. ➡ 🟢 He said "no" (direct speech). <br/>
> 🔴 He liked the book but I no. ➡ 🟢 He liked the book but I did not. <br/>
> 🔴 I was hungry but he no. ➡ 🟢 I was hungry but he was not. <br/>

### No (as determiner)

💡*žádný*

In this case **no** stands before a noun. If a noun has adjectives, it stands before all adjectives.

> There was no snow. <br/>
> I have no money. <br/>
> If there are no questions, we can end the meeting. <br/>
> I have no money. <br/>
> There were no people. <br/>

Most often it is used with a **uncountable noun** (no money, no air, no snow, no water, no information, ...) or with
a **plural noun** (no people, no trees, no children, no pencils, ...).

Rarely can be used with a singular noun (except when we want to add emphasis on the **no**).

> I knocked but there was no answer. <br/>
> She has no child. ➡ She does not have a child. <br/>
> No child should suffer discrimination. <br/>
> No question is a stupid question. <br/>

### Not

We use **not** as a negation of a sentence.

> I am not a good player. <br/>
> He liked the book but I did not. <br/>

**Not** can stand before:

* noun
* pronoun
* adverb
* adverbial determination
* fragment (an incomplete sentence)

> Not me. <br/>
> Not today. <br/>
> Not now. <br/>
> I will tell you about it but not here. <br/>

We use a phrase **or not** *(💡nebo ne)* as follows:
> We will go there whether you like it or not. <br/>
> We could go out. Or not <br/>

#### Phrases with NOT

##### Not really

💡*ne tak docela, ani ne*

We can use it if we do not want to use just "no" outright.

> Did you like the movie? Not really. <br/>
> Did she thank you for the flowers? Not really. <br/>
> Did you apologize to him? Not really. <br/>
> Do you feel like going out? Not really. <br/>

##### Not at all

💡*vůbec ne*

When we use **at all** in a negative sentence, we add emphasis on negation.

> I do not like him at all. <br/>
> Do you mind if I open the window? Not at all. <br/>
> Did I offend you in any way? Oh, not at all. <br/>

##### Not yet

💡*ještě ne*

> Have you finished? Not yet. <br/>
> Has Susan seen your new boyfriend? Not yet. <br/>
> Are you ready? Not yet. <br/>

##### Not anymore

💡*už ne*

We use **not anymore** in questions where we ask whether something is true or not. Words like **still**, **yet** often
appear in these questions.

> Do you still live here? Not anymore. <br/>
> Does she still love him? No, not anymore. <br/>
> Do you want to come with us? Not anymore. <br/>

##### Not necessarily

💡*nutně ne, není to tak jisté*

> Do we have to arrive by 9? Not necessarily. <br/>
> She will get fired. Not necessarily. <br/>

### None

pronoun

> He wanted to buy some books, but he got none. *(none = no books)* <br/>
> I asked my friends for help but none helped me. *(none = no friends)* <br/>
> Did you drink all the beer? There is none left in the fridge. *(none = no beer)* <br/>
> 🔴 I have none friends. ➡ 🟢 I have no friends. <br/>
> 🔴 There is no in the fridge. ➡ 🟢 There is none in the fridge. <br/>

#### Phrases with NONE

##### None of

💡*žádný z*
> None of them helped me. <br/>
> None of the children brought an umbrella. <br/>
> None of the money went to charity. <br/>
> None of the students is/are very smart. <br/>

If we use **none of** with a plural noun, we can then use either singular (✏formal) or plural verb (🗣informal).

##### None other than

💡*nikdo jiný než*

> I realized that the person in front of me was no other than mz mother. <br/>
> It was revealed that Robert I. was no other than Robert II. <br/>

##### None but ✏

💡*pouze*

✏formal variant of **only**

> He says that French cuisine is for none but the brave. <br/>
> None but you can help me. <br/>

##### None the + comparative

💡*o nic lepší / moudřejší / ...*

> He is none the better than you. <br/>
> She did apologize to him, but he felt none the better. <br/>
> She has explained everything but I'm none the wiser. <br/>

### Neither

determiner or pronoun

Almost the similar usage to **no** and **none**, but in this case we talk about two things.

> Neither parent had money to support the child. *(mother or father)* <br/>
> No parent likes to see their child unhappy. *(parents generally)* <br/>

**Neither** can be used with a singular noun (neither parent), with a preposition (neither of the parents) or as a
pronoun.
> Neither eye was damaged. <br/>
> Neither answer was right. <br/>
> She liked neither option. <br/>
> She liked neither of her two math teachers. <br/>
> Neither of the parents was / were present. <br/>
> If neither of the teams score/scores, it's a draw. <br/>
> Which one do you like, the black one or the green one? Neither. <br/>
> I thought she would kill me or at least hit me, but she did neither. <br/>

As with **none of**, if we use **neither of** with a plural noun, we can then use either singular (✏formal) or plural
verb (🗣informal).

We can use **neither** together with **nor** (💡*ani to, ani ono*).

> She liked neither the blue one nor the red one. <br/>
> She neither killed me nor hit me. <br/>

### Nobody / no one / nothing

pronouns

* nobody = no one (*used with persons*) 💡*nikdo, nikoho, nikomu*
* nothing *(used with things)*💡*nic*

> No one helped me. <br/>
> She had nothing in her pockets. <br/>
> I'm sorry. There is nothing I can do about it. <br/>

Pay attention to the difference between **nobody** / **no one** / **nothing** and **none**. **None** can be used both
with persons and things, but it must have any context.

> None helped me. *(context: I asked my friends for help.)* <br/>
> No one helped me. *(generally)* <br/>
> I found none. *(context: I was searching for my friends.)* <br/>
> I found nothing. *(generally)* <br/>

# TODOs

never

##### Really

💡*opravdu, vážně, skutečně*

###### positive sentences ➡ still the same meaning

> I really like it. 💡*Opravdu se mi to líbí.* <br/>
> She really missed you. 💡*Vážně jsi jí chyběl.* <br/>

###### negative sentences ➡ the meaning depends on the possition

* before the negative (strong) 💡*vůbec ne, opravdu ne*
* after the negative (soft) 💡*ani ne, v podstatě ne, ani moc ne*

> I really don't want to go there. 💡*Opravdu tam nechci jít.* <br/>
> I don't really want to go there. 💡*Ani tam moc nechci jít.* <br/>
> She really didn't understand him. 💡*Opravdu mu nerozuměla.* <br/>
> She didn't really understand him. 💡*Ani mu moc nerozuměla.* <br/>

> She didn't really like the desert, but didn't say anything. <br/>
> I don't really want to go with you. <br/>
> My parents don't really know him. <br/>
> I'm glad he's been fired. I never really liked him. <br/>
