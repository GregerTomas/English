### Names of places

If a general noun is part of the name then the first letter of the noun is capitalised as well (mountains, river, lake,
street, park, ...).

If the determiner **a**, **an** or **the** or preposition (**to**, **of**, **by**, **on**, ...) is part of the name then
they are not capitalised.

## Comma

### Mains sentences

We can use a comma before the conjunctions **and** or **but**. A comma is not necessary in case of a short sentences.

> He opened the door and entered. <br/>
> I write songs but nobody likes them. <br/>
> He has made numerous complaints about the faulty product, but the company does not answer his phone calls. <br/>

### Subordinate sentences

#### Time, conditionals, concession (pÅ™Ã­pustkovÃ¡) clauses

The use of a comma depends on the order of the sentences. We use a comma in case when a subordinate clause is
followed by a main clause.

> You don't have to come if you don't want to. ðŸ†š If you don't want to, you don't have to come. <br/>
> I make dinner when I come home from work. ðŸ†š When I come home from work, I make dinner. <br/>
> There aren't many shops where he lives. ðŸ†š Where he lives, there aren't many shops. <br/>
> He goes jogging every day although he's quite old. ðŸ†š Although he's quite old, he goes jogging every day. <br/>

#### Relative clauses

It depends on whether the minor clause is defining (determines a necessary context) or non-defining (it gives just
additional information).

> Bill Murray, who is my favourite actor, is making a new film. <br/>
> Our house, which is quite old, will be repaired next year. <br/>
> Mr. Davies, whose son goes to school with Mark, is coming to see us on Friday night. <br/>
> The actress who starred in Lost in Translation is quite pretty. <br/>
> The house where we live will be repaired next year. <br/>
> The man who lives next door has bought a new cat. <br/>

#### Object clauses, wishes

A comma is not used.

> I don't know where you live. <br/>
> He told me that he was hungry. <br/>
> He doesn't know if he will be back in time for dinner. <br/>
> Tell me what you want to do. <br/>

> I wish you were here. <br/>
> I wish I had more time. <br/>

#### Direct speech

A comma is used.

> He asked, "What's your name?" <br/>
> Julia said, "Oh, I'm so tired." <br/>

#### Adverbs

We use commas for adverbs that are used to specify a context, a personal attitude.

> He did what he could. However, he failed. <br/>
> Unfortunately, it started raining. <br/>
> First, I would like to tell you something about its history. <br/>
> He jumped onto the stage and, to my surprise, started singing. <br/>

#### Adverbial determiners

If we move an adverbial determiner to the beginning of a sentence, it is good to separate it with a comma.

> In 1994, he started to work for BBC. <br/>
> In my house, we don't have any carpets. <br/>
> After breakfast, I usually go to work. <br/>

#### List of items

We write a comma before **and** only in case when the last item is "long".

> I bought a pizza, some bread, two beers and a newspaper. <br/>
> I bought a pizza, some bread, two beers, and a funny-looking soft toy for my daughter. <br/>

#### Adjectives

We use a comma only if they do not stand before a noun or if we express our opinion.

> She was tall, slim and sexy. <br/>
> I saw an interesting, funny movie. <br/>
