# Questions

There are two types of questions:

* **yes / no**
* **w-questions** *(what, where, who)*

Normally, we use a subject-verb inversion.

## Questions to subject (part of the subject)

There is no inversion of word order in this case.

> What is coming? <br/>
> Who are you waiting for? <br/>
> Who likes pizza? <br/>
> Who visits you every day?
> What happened? <br/>
> How many people arrived? <br/>
> Who saw you? 🆚 Who did see you? <br/>

## Questions with announcement word order

We can use announcement word order in yes / no questions. We do not expect new information, but we express surprise and
we expect just a confirmation or a rebuttal (💡*Je to skutečně tak, jak si myslím? Je to tak, jak to vypadá?*).

> Does Sarah like Shakespeare? 💡*Sarah is my friend and I am asking another friend about her preferences.* <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> Sarah likes Shakespeare? 💡*I see Sarah reading a book from Shakespeare and I am quite surprised.* <br/>

> Did you buy me a present? <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> You bought me a present? 💡*I am surprised that you bought me something.* <br/>

> Did you get into a fight again? <br/>
> 🆚 <br/>
> You got into a fight again? 💡*I just want confirmation because I see your monocle.* <br/>
