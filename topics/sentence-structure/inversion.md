# Inversion

An interchanged of a subject and a verb.

## Partial inversion

💡 subject - auxiliary verb inversion

In negative sentences, **not** is not moved before the subject (it is possible only in questions or exclamative clauses)
.

> he is working ➡ is he working <br/>
> he has been gone ➡ has he been gone <br/>
> he can dance ➡ can he dance <br/>
> he must have been sad ➡ must he have been sad <br/>
> he likes music ➡ does he like music <br/>
> he went home ➡ did he go home <br/>
> he won't go ➡ will he not go <br/>
> he hasn't been studying ➡ has he not been studying <br/>

### Question tags

We use the inversion with words like **so**, **nor** or **neither**.

> I'm ready. So am I! ➡ 🗣 Mee too. <br/>
> My kids are sick and so is my wife. ➡ 🗣 My kids are sick and my wife too. <br/>
> I like her new hair. So do I. <br/>
> I love their music and so does my wife. <br/>
> We've been working hard but so have our competitors. <br/>
> If he can take a day off, then so can we. <br/>
> If you use bad language, then so will your children. <br/>

> I don't want to go. Neither do I. ➡ ✏ Nor do I. ➡ 🗣 Me neither. <br/>
> I've never been to New York. Neither have I. ➡ ✏ Nor have I. <br/>
> I don't want to go. – Neither do I. <br/>
> I didn't understand any of it. Neither did I. <br/>
> He will never stop but neither will I. <br/>
> My brother can't afford it and neither can I. <br/>
> I won't help you and neither will anyone else. <br/>
> I'm not interested in football. Nor am I. <br/>

### Negative word at the beginning of the sentence

Most often an adverbial determination or subject. We add emphasis on the negation.

> hardly <br/>
> barely 💡*sotva, stěží* <br/>
> seldom 💡*zřídka* <br/>
> rarely <br/>
> now way <br/>
> by no means 💡*v žádném případě* <br/>
> not now <br/>
> not once <br/>
> not always <br/>
> little 💡*vůbec, skoro vůbec* <br/>

> Never will we give up looking for answers. 💡*We will never give up.* <br/>
> Seldom did we have so many guests in our house. 💡*We seldom had.* <br/>
> Not once did he say sorry to me. Not once! 💡*He didn't say sorry to me once.* <br/>
> Barely had I fallen asleep, when the cat started meowing. 💡*I had barely fallen.* <br/>
> Not a sound did they make! 💡*They didn't make a sound* <br/>
> Seldom did we have so many guests in our house. <br/>
> Rarely have I tasted something so delicious! <br/>
> Hardly did they ever fight. <br/>
> Barely did he survive the crash. <br/>
> Not always can we be right. <br/>
> I never wanted to end up like my parents. Little did I know. <br/>

#### Little

> Little did we know that he would become one of the richest men in the country. <br/>
> Little did she care that the tattoo was permanent. <br/>
> Little did they understand that their days were numbered. <br/>

#### Only

> Only then did I realise that they had lied to me. <br/>
> You need to apologise first. Only then can she forgive you. <br/>
> Only once will I ask you. <br/>
> Only now can you get a deal as great as this. <br/>
> Only through hard work can you achieve your dreams. <br/>
> Only with you do I feel I can be myself. <br/>

The inversion is moved to the main verb if it is a sentence with an adverbial subordinate sentence.

> 🔴 Only if do you complain you will get a refund. ➡ 🟢 Only if you complain will you get a refund. <br/>
> Only after he apologised did she forgive him. <br/>
> Only when you're in love do you do crazy things like this. <br/>

#### Not only

It is often used with the conjunction **but** or with adverbs like **also**, **too**, **as well**, **either**, etc.

> Not only was it raining but also it was really cold! <br/>
> Not only did I lose my wallet, I also missed my last train home. <br/>
> Not only did I fail the test, but I also had the lowest score in my class. <br/>
> Not only will he get promoted, but he will get a company car, too. <br/>
> Not only has she given me her number, but she asked me out as well. <br/>

There can be a negation after **not only**, which cannot be shortened.

> Not only did I not go to work, but I didn't do any work at home either. <br/>
> Not only does the medicine not work, but your condition could even worsen! <br/>
> 🔴 Not only won't I help you now ➡ 🟢 Not only will I not help you now, I will not help you ever! <br/>

#### So and such

> He was so rich that he bought a Lamborghini. ➡ So rich was he that he bought a Lamborghini. <br/>
> It was such a bad book that he didn't want to read it. ➡ Such a bad book was it that he didn't want to read it. <br/>
> So cold was the rain, that we decided to return home. <br/>
> So slowly did he drive that other drivers honked their horns at him. <br/>
> Such was the weather, that the concert has to be moved indoors. <br/>

#### ✏ Formal conditionals

The **if** conjunction is omitted in the formal conditionals.

#### 1st conditional

💡 real conditions for present and future

We use the inversion with the modal verb **should**. In this case, **should** means 💡*snad, náhodou*. **Not** cannot be
shortened.

> If you should have any questions, please contact us. ➡ Should you have any questions, please contact us. <br/>
> If you should want to ... ➡ Should you want to buy another house, our realtors will gladly assist you. <br/>
> If it should rain ... ➡ Should it rain, we will move the party indoors. <br/>
> Should you leave, I will wait patiently until you come back. <br/>
> 🔴 Shouldn't you receive ... ➡ 🟢 Should you not receive the package within two weeks, please call this number. <br/>

#### 2nd conditional

💡 unreal conditions in present (*kdyby teď něco, tak by teď něco*)

We use the inversion with the verb **were**. **Not** cannot be
shortened. A phrase with **were** + **infinitive** is often used.

> If he were taller, he would be able to reach the top shelf. ➡ Were he taller, he would be able to reach the top
> shelf. <br/>
> If she were ... ➡ Were she in a position to change anything, she certainly would. <br/>
> If we weren't ... ➡ Were we not convinced, we wouldn't accept the offer. <br/>
> Were they interested in meeting with us, we would arrange a date. <br/>
> Were it not for her, I would be in trouble. <br/>
> If he ran away, who would stop him? ➡ If he were to run away, who would stop him? ➡ Were he to run away, who would
> stop him? <br/>
> Were you to leave this house, you would put yourself in danger. <br/>
> Were I to get a second chance, I would do my best. <br/>
> 🔴 Was I in your shoes ... ➡ 🟢 Were I in your shoes ... <br/>

#### 3rd conditional

💡 unreal conditions in past (*kdyby býval tehdy*)

> If they had arrived on time, they would have seen her. ➡ Had they arrived on time, they would have seen her. <br/>
> Had we tried harder, we would have won. <br/>
> Had they stayed quiet, things would have gone much better for them. <br/>
> Had the government listened to the voices of the people, the revolution would have been avoided. <br/>
> Had he not joined the army, he would still be alive. <br/>

## Full inversion

💡 subject - main verb inversion

### Direct speech

> He said: "I love you." 💡*direct speech* ➡ He told her he loved her. 💡*indirect speech* <br/>

* **reporting clauses** - who said it, how it was said
* **reported clauses** - sentence in quotes, what was said

In general reported clauses are used before reporting ones, but both variants are possible.

#### Reported + reporting

The direct speech must have a punctuation (dot, comma, question mark, exclamation).

> "Well, 'bout damn time!" I said. <br/>
> "No, it's not like that," Chelsea answered. <br/>

#### Reporting + reported

The comma as a separator must be used.

> I said, "Well, 'bout damn time!" <br/>

#### Reporting verbs

> ask <br/>
> say <br/>
> tell <br/>
> cry <br/>
> exclaim 💡*vykřiknout* <br/>
> reply <br/>
> shout <br/>
> yell <br/>
> scream <br/>
> whisper <br/>
> promise <br/>
> suggest <br/>
> warn <br/>
> claim 💡*tvrdit* <br/>
> inform <br/>
> demand 💡*žádal* <br/>
> murmur 💡*šeptat* <br/>
> mumble 💡*mumlat* <br/>
> stutter 💡*koktat* <br/>
> think <br/>
> be like <br/>

#### 📚 Inversion

> "It's over," said Jack. <br/>
> "That's beautiful!" exclaimed my sister. <br/>
> "Where have you been?" inquired his wife sharply. <br/>

The inversion is not possible when a personal pronoun is used as a subject.

> 🔴 "It's over," said he. ➡ 🟢 "It's over," he said. <br/>
> 🔴 "That's beautiful!" exclaimed she. ➡ 🟢 "That's beautiful!" she exclaimed. <br/>
> 🔴 "Where have you been?" inquired she. ➡ 🟢 "Where have you been?" she inquired sharply. <br/>

### Adverbs here and there

We use the full inversion if there is an adverb **here** (💡*něco přichází*) or **there** (💡*něco ujelo*) at the
beginning of the sentence and the subject is not a personal pronoun.

> Oh, here comes my train. Bye! <br/>
> "Here comes trouble," I thought to myself. <br/>
> "Here comes another problem," she said. <br/>
> Look kids, here comes Santa Claus! <br/>
> Oh no, here come the tears again. <br/>
> Here we go! 💡*A je to tady!* <br/>
> 🔴 Here comes it ... ➡ 🟢 Here it comes. Here comes more drama! <br/>
> Here you go. / Here you are. 💡*Tady to máš.* <br/>

> Look, we're late! There goes our train! <br/>
> "There goes my bonus," I thought. <br/>
> "We need to talk," Harry says and there goes her smile. <br/>
> 🔴 ... There went it, just like that. ➡ 🟢 He lost all the money. There it went, just like that. 💡*Byly pryč, prostě jen
tak.* <br/>
> There you go. 💡*Tady to máš.* <br/>
