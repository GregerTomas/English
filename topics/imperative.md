# Imperative

<hr/>

## Default imperative

We use just a verb, nothing else. Singular and plural, does not matter.

We use **!** only for very strong imperatives (otherwise a dot is enough).

> Come here! 💡*pojď / pojďte* <br/>
> Help me! 💡pomoz / pomozte <br/>
> Open the door, please. 💡*otevři / otevřte* <br/>
> Go home. 💡*běž / běžte* <br/>

For negative imperatives, just add **don't**.

> Go! ➡ Don't go! 💡*nechoď / nechoďte* <br/>
> Speak! ➡ Don't speak! 💡*nemluv / nemluvte* <br/>
> Don't cry! 💡*neplač / neplačte* <br/>
> Don't be mad. 💡*nezlob se / nezlobte se* <br/>
> Don't worry. 💡*nedělej / nedělejte si starosti* <br/>
> Don't stop the music. 💡*nevypínej / nevypínejte* <br/>

### Emphasis of the imperative

#### Expressed subject

The subject is often unexpressed. If we add the subject (**you**, **nobody**, **anybody**), we add emphasis on the
imperative.
> Don't you touch me! <br/>
> Everybody stay where you are. <br/>
> Don't anyone take it personally. <br/>

The target person can be addressed as follows (separated by a comma).
> Listen to me, **son**. <br/>
> **Rex**, sit! Good boy! <br/>

#### Always and never

> Always wash your hands after touching animals. <br/>
> Never call me again. <br/>

#### Do (urgency)

> Do sit down. <br/>
> Do be careful! <br/>

#### Question tags

We use **will you** or **would you** (💡*buď tak hodný / ano?*) as a question tag.

A tag can be negative, then it is more urgent.

> Help me out, will you? <br/>
> Be quiet for a minute, will you? <br/>
> Don't be so loud, would you? <br/>
> Come here, won't you? <br/>

<hr/>

## First person singular

In this case we use **let's (let us)** and **shall we** as question tag.

It is rather suggestion than order.

> Let's go already.  
> Let's get married!  
> Let's go out sometime.  
> Let's be honest.  
> Let's go, guys.   
> Let's not waste time.  
> Let's not make any rash decisions.

Let's (*imperative*) 🆚 let us (*request/application*)

> Let's stay here tonight. 💡*navrhuji (nám) to* <br/>
> Let us stay here tonight. 💡*žádám někoho o svolení* <br/>

<hr/>

## Third person singular + plural

We can use let as well (💡*ať*).

> Let him walk you home after the movie. 💡*Ať tě po filmu odvede domů.*<br/>
> I'm not afraid of them. Let them come! 💡*Nebojím se jich, Ať přijdou.*<br/>
> I always do the dishes. Let Carl do it for a change! <br/>
> Let there be light! <br/>
> Don't let him go. <br/>

We are unable to distinguish the imperative and the request/application without a context.
> Let him do it. 💡*Ať to udělá.* <br/>
> Let him do it. 💡*Dovol mu, aby to udělal.* <br/>
