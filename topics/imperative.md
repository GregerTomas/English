# Imperative

## Default imperative
We use just a verb, nothing else. Singular and plural.. does not matter.
We use **!** only for a very strong imperatives (otherwise dot is enough).

```
Come here! (pojď/pojďte) 🛑
Help me! (pomoz/pomozte)
Open the door, please. (otevři/otevřte)
Go home. (běž/běžte)
```
