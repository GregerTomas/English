# Imperative

## Default imperative
We use just a verb, nothing else. Singular and plural, does not matter.

We use **!** only for very strong imperatives (otherwise a dot is enough).

> Come here! 💡*pojď/pojďte* <br/>
> Help me! 💡pomoz/pomozte <br/>
> Open the door, please. 💡*otevři/otevřte* <br/>
> Go home. 💡*běž/běžte*
